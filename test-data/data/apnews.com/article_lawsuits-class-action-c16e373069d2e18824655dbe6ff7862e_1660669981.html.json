(“Enochian” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ENOB) and certain of its officers, on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired Enochian securities between September 24, 2020 and May 31, 2022, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: www.bgandg.com/enob .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).\nThe complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Gumrukcu was not a licensed doctor and had no verifiable degrees beyond high school; (2) accordingly, the scientific and technological underpinnings of Enochian’s product pipeline, purportedly invented by Gumrukcu, were dubious at best; (3) accordingly, the Defendants had significantly overstated the commercial prospects for the Company’s product pipeline; (4) Enochian’s senior leadership knew Gumrukcu had a criminal history that included fraud; (5) accordingly, Enochian’s reliance on Gumrukcu, and its consulting and licensing agreements with G-Tech and SRI, subjected the Company to a heightened risk of reputational and financial harm, as well as threatened the integrity of the Company’s scientific findings; and (6) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
