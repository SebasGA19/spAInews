The transactions, which closed late in the second quarter and early in the third quarter, added current production, approximately 20,000 net acres and additional high-return development opportunities\nAs of July 29, 2022, approximately $46 million had been returned to shareholders through share repurchases since program initiation in May 2022\nContinued strengthening of capital structure with a leverage ratio2 of approximately 0.8x at quarter-end, incorporating approximately $50 million reduction in total net debt1 since year-end 2021\nADVERTISEMENT\n“We continue to perform exceptionally well year-to-date, generating significant free cash flow through disciplined investments while capturing numerous accretive bolt-ons that are expected to add value for years to come,” said Ranger President and CEO, Darrin Henke. “For the second quarter, our capital investments remained on track and our sales volumes were at the high-end of our guidance. During the quarter, we were able to expand our cash return framework as we reloaded and extended our share buyback program and initiated our first quarterly dividend. We have significantly increased our cash flow through both organic growth and strategic consolidation while simultaneously decreasing our share count and leverage. This has resulted in significant growth in cash-on-cash returns for our investors.”\nSecond Quarter 2022 Financial and Operating Results\nRanger reported a second quarter 2022 net income of $148.0 million. Adjusted net income1 was $120.4 million for the second quarter of 2022. Ranger posted adjusted EBITDAX1 of $189.8 million, net cash provided by operating activities of $165.0 million and generated pro forma adjusted free cash flow1 of $61.6 million during the quarter.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTotal operating expenses for the second quarter of 2022 were $109.2 million, or $31.20 per boe. Adjusted direct operating expenses1 were $52.5 million, or $14.98 per boe, in the second quarter of 2022 which consist of lease operating expenses (“LOE”), gathering, processing and transportation expenses (“GPT”), production and ad valorem taxes, and adjusted cash general and administrative expenses1 (“G&A”), excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) and significant special charges. A breakdown of operating expenses, as well as guidance for the remainder of the year, can be found in additional tables included in this release.\nTotal sales volumes for the second quarter of 2022 were at the upper-end of Ranger’s guidance at 38.5 Mboe/d (71% crude oil/86% liquids). Oil sales during the quarter were 27.5 Mbbl/d, also toward the high-end of Ranger’s previous guidance (26.6 - 27.8 Mbbl/d).\nExpanded Shareholder Return Program\nRanger recently expanded its cash return framework for shareholders, increasing its share buyback authorization and declaring a cash dividend.\nAs of July 29, 2022, Ranger has repurchased approximately $46 million (1.35 million shares) of its Class A common stock, or more than 3% of total equity outstanding, at an average price of approximately $33.67 per share.\nIn early July, Ranger’s Board of Directors increased its share repurchase authorization by $40 million to $140 million and extended the program term through June 30, 2023.\nThe Board declared an inaugural cash dividend of $0.075 per share of Class A common stock, payable August 4, 2022 to Class A common stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 25, 2022.\nADVERTISEMENT\n2022 Outlook\nAlong with the increase in anticipated sales volumes for 2022 noted above, Ranger expects its capital expenditures for the original 2022 development plan (“Initial D&C”) to remain within the previously announced range at approximately $425 million, due to the Company effectively managing the ongoing inflationary environment. In addition, as a result of sustained operating efficiencies driving accelerated development activity, combined with increased working interests and longer laterals following recent bolt-ons, Ranger is increasing its capital expenditures outlook by an incremental $30 million (“Incremental D&C”). The Incremental D&C is expected to benefit future sales volumes and increase development efficiencies.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRanger’s third quarter capital expenditure guidance reflects its temporary use of a third drilling rig, which is developing assets located in LaSalle County, approximately 180 miles southwest of Ranger’s development activity in Gonzales and Lavaca counties. After the wells in LaSalle are completed, which is anticipated to conclude in the third quarter, Ranger expects to maintain a two-rig development pace in the fourth quarter. The Company is considering adding a third rig to its development program in early 2023 based on its decreasing leverage, increased acreage position, and the strong projected returns and free cash flow generated by its deep inventory at current commodity prices. This potential increase in activity would create additional momentum in early 2023 and significantly benefit full-year 2023 sales volumes.\nThe table below sets forth the Company’s updated operational and financial guidance for the third quarter and full-year 2022 as well as a summary of prior guidance as reported in March and May 2022:\nFull Year 2022 Prior March 2022 Outlook Midpoint4 Prior May 2022 Outlook Midpoint4 Current Outlook 3Q 2022 Total Sales Volumes (boe/d) 39,750 40,000 40,400 - 42,000 40,900 - 42,500 Oil Sales Volumes (bbl/d) 28,500 28,750 28,700 - 30,300 29,900 - 31,100 Direct Operating Expenses LOE (per boe) $ 5.20 $ 5.20 $ 5.35 - $5.85 $ 5.75 - $6.25 GPT expenses (per boe) $ 2.40 $ 2.40 $ 2.50 - $2.80 $ 2.50 - $2.90 Ad valorem and production taxes (% of product revenue) 6.25 % 6.25 % 5.75% - 6.25% 5.6 Adjusted Cash G&A expenses (per boe) 1 $ 2.30 $ 2.30 $ 2.00 - $2.50 $ 1.90 - $2.40 Capital Expenditures (millions) Initial Drilling & Completion $ 400 $ 400 ~$4253 Incremental Drilling & Completion ~$303 Total Drilling & Completion $ 400 $ 400 $ 440 - $470 $ 135 - $160\nADVERTISEMENT\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of June 30, 2022, Ranger had $400 million of senior unsecured notes and approximately $137 million drawn, net of cash, on its revolving credit facility. This represents a reduction in net debt1 from year-end 2021 to June 30, 2022 of approximately $50 million. The Company’s borrowing base under its revolving credit facility was recently increased to $875 million, with elected commitments of $400 million. Ranger is currently undergoing an additional borrowing base redetermination to reflect the Company’s recent increase in producing reserves and bolt-on acquisitions.\n1 Adjusted EBITDAX, pro forma adjusted free cash flow, adjusted net income, net debt, LTM pro forma adjusted EBITDAX, adjusted direct operating expenses and adjusted cash G&A are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures.

The following table presents the calculation of our non-GAAP realized prices for crude oil, NGLs, natural gas and aggregate, as adjusted for the effects of derivatives, net and reconciles to realized prices for crude oil, NGLs, natural gas and aggregate determined in accordance with GAAP:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 March 31, 2022 June 30, 2021 June 30, 2022 June 30, 2021 Realized crude oil prices ($/bbl) $ 109.34 $ 93.38 $ 63.54 $ 101.48 $ 60.07 Effects of derivatives, net ($/bbl) (24.91 ) (19.38 ) (10.84 ) (22.19 ) (10.89 ) Crude oil realized prices, including effects of derivatives, net ($/bbl) $ 84.43 $ 74.00 $ 52.70 $ 79.29 $ 49.18 Realized natural gas liquid prices ($/bbl) $ 36.77 $ 33.40 $ 18.31 $ 35.11 $ 17.68 Effects of derivatives, net ($/bbl) (1.67 ) - (0.44 ) (0.84 ) (0.24 ) Natural gas liquid realized prices, including effects of derivatives, net ($/bbl) $ 35.10 $ 33.40 $ 17.87 $ 34.27 $ 17.44 Realized natural gas prices ($/Mcf) $ 7.19 $ 4.32 $ 2.70 $ 5.78 $ 2.75 Effects of derivatives, net ($/Mcf) (3.11 ) (0.36 ) 0.01 (1.76 ) 0.02 Natural gas realized prices, including effects of derivatives, net ($/Mcf) $ 4.08 $ 3.96 $ 2.71 $ 4.02 $ 2.77 Aggregate realized prices ($/boe) $ 89.51 $ 75.23 $ 54.75 $ 82.48 $ 51.62 Effects of derivatives, net ($/boe) (20.64 ) (14.15 ) (8.82 ) (17.45 ) (8.76 ) Aggregate realized prices, including effects of derivatives, net ($/boe) $ 68.87 $ 61.08 $ 45.93 $ 65.03 $ 42.86\nEffects of derivatives includes, as applicable to the period presented: (i) current period commodity derivative settlements; (ii) the impact of option premiums paid or received in prior periods related to current period production; (iii) the impact of prior period cash settlements of early-terminated derivatives originally designated to settle against current period production; (iv) the exclusion of option premiums paid or received in current period related to future period production; and (v) the exclusion of the impact of current period cash settlements for early-terminated derivatives originally designated to settle against future period production.\nReconciliation of GAAP “Net income (loss)” to Non-GAAP “Adjusted net income”\nAdjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net income (loss) adjusted to include net realized settlements of derivatives and exclude the effects, net of income taxes, of non-cash changes in the fair value of derivatives, impairments of oil and gas properties, the effects of gains and losses on the sales of assets, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition, integration and strategic transaction costs, and organizational restructuring costs, including severance. We believe that non-GAAP adjusted net income provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance. This information facilitates management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Since management finds this measure to be useful, the Company believes that our investors can benefit by evaluating both non-GAAP and GAAP results. Adjusted net income is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income (loss).\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 March 31, 2022 June 30, 2021 June 30, 2022 June 30, 2021 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net income (loss) $ 148,040 $ (20,661 ) $ 7,596 $ 127,379 $ (12,425 ) Adjustments for derivatives: Net losses 44,942 167,887 54,227 212,829 98,595 Realized settlements, net 1 (72,769 ) (49,004 ) (20,900 ) (121,773 ) (37,882 ) Impairments of oil and gas properties - - - - 1,811 Gain on sales of assets, net (10 ) (188 ) - (198 ) (4 ) (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt - (2,157 ) - (2,157 ) 1,231 Acquisition, integration and strategic transaction costs 435 1,743 - 2,178 4,655 Organizational restructuring costs, including severance - - - - 239 Income tax effect of adjustments (240 ) 1,072 (735 ) 791 (761 ) Adjusted net income 2 $ 120,398 $ 98,692 $ 40,188 $ 219,049 $ 55,459\n1 Realized settlements, net includes, as applicable to the period presented: (i) current period commodity and interest rate derivative settlements; (ii) the impact of option premiums paid or received in prior periods related to current period production; (iii) the impact of prior period cash settlements of early-terminated derivatives originally designated to settle against current period production; (iv) the exclusion of option premiums paid or received in current period related to future period production; and (v) the exclusion of the impact of current period cash settlements for early-terminated derivatives originally designated to settle against future period production.\n2 Adjusted net income includes the adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for all periods presented.\nReconciliation of GAAP “Net income (loss)” to Non-GAAP “Adjusted EBITDAX” - Actual\nAdjusted EBITDAX represents net income (loss) before (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, interest expense, income taxes, impairments of oil and gas properties, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and share-based compensation expense, further adjusted to include the net commodity realized settlements of derivatives and exclude the effects of gains and losses on sales of assets, non-cash changes in the fair value of derivatives, and special items including acquisition, integration and strategic transaction costs, and organizational restructuring costs, including severance. We believe this presentation is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts for the valuation, comparison, rating, investment recommendations of companies within the oil and gas exploration and production industry.

Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDAX as defined by Ranger Oil may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) and other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (a GAAP measure), adjusted for: gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt, cash and deposits paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired), cash paid for capital expenditures, cash proceeds from sales of assets, (discounts) premiums associated with proceeds of debt offerings, assumption (repayments) of acquired and other debt, proceeds from noncontrolling interests (net of transaction/issuance costs paid), share repurchases, withholding taxes for share-based compensation and debt issuance costs paid. Pro Forma Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted Free Cash Flow and includes changes to beginning Net debt to incorporate the effects of the Lonestar Acquisition and share repurchases and cash and deposits paid for acquisitions. We believe Adjusted Free Cash Flow is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts for the valuation, comparison, rating, investment recommendations of companies in many industries. Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Pro Forma Adjusted Free Cash Flow should be considered as a supplement to net income as a measure of performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2022 Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2022 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities: $ 165,049 $ 298,884 $ 464,684 Gain on extinguishment of debt - 2,157 2,157 Cash paid for acquisitions 1 (45,976 ) (45,976 ) (34,967 ) Cash paid for capital expenditures (103,071 ) (174,244 ) (334,881 ) Cash deposits for acquisitions of oil and gas properties (6,411 ) (6,411 ) (6,411 ) Cash proceeds from sales of assets (34 ) 622 629 Discounts associated with proceeds of debt offerings - - (3,928 ) Assumption (repayments) of acquired and other debt (92 ) (175 ) (252,032 ) Cash paid for share repurchases (24,127 ) (24,127 ) (24,127 ) Withholding taxes for share-based compensation (205 ) (650 ) (792 ) Debt issuance costs paid (41 ) (154 ) (12,691 ) Adjusted Free Cash Flow $ (14,908 ) $ 49,926 $ (202,359 ) Pro Forma changes in Net debt 2 - - 325,349 Cash paid for share repurchases 24,127 24,127 24,127 Cash and deposits paid for acquisitions 52,387 52,387 52,387 Pro Forma Adjusted Free Cash Flow $ 61,606 $ 126,440 $ 199,504\n1 Twelve months ended June 30, 2022 includes cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash of $11.0 million in connection with the Lonestar Acquisition.\n2 Net debt at the beginning of the period has been adjusted for the net cash effects of the Lonestar Acquisition. See the following table for adjustments to Net debt.\nNet Debt\nNet debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as total principal amount of long-term debt, excluding unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, less cash and cash equivalents. Long-term debt excludes non-recourse mortgage debt assumed with the Lonestar Acquisition. The most comparable financial measure to Net debt under GAAP is principal amount of long-term debt. Net debt is used by management as a measure of our financial leverage. Net debt should not be used by investors or others as the sole basis in formulating investment decisions as it does not represent the Company’s actual indebtedness.\nJune 30, 2022 March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 June 30, 2021 Actual Actual Actual Actual Pro Forma Adjusted 2 (in thousands) Credit Facility $ 171,000 $ 128,000 $ 208,000 $ 238,900 $ 238,900 9.25% Senior Notes due 2026 400,000 400,000 400,000 - 400,000 Second Lien facility, excludes unamortized discount and issue costs - - - 144,985 144,985 Other debt 1 - - 2,157 - - Lonestar transaction 2 - - - - (74,651 ) Cash and cash equivalents (34,450 ) (6,358 ) (23,681 ) (49,694 ) (49,694 ) Net debt $ 536,550 $ 521,642 $ 586,476 $ 334,191 $ 659,540\n1 Other debt of $2.2 million was extinguished during the three months ended March 31, 2022.\n2 Adjustments attributable to the Lonestar Acquisition and related debt repayments and hedge restructurings include (i) gross proceeds from the 9.25% Senior Notes due 2026 of $400 million less $3.9 million original issue discount, (ii) debt repayments totaling $392.7 million for the Second Lien Term Loan and Lonestar’s debt, (iii) hedge restructuring costs of $49.6 million and (iv) transaction expenses of $28.5 million.\nContact:\nInvestor Relations\nPh: (713) 722-6540\nE-Mail: invest@rangeroil.com\nSOURCE: Ranger Oil Corporation\nView source version on accesswire.com:\nhttps://www.accesswire.com/710587/Ranger-Oil-Corporation-Reports-Second-Quarter-Results", "url": "https://apnews.com/press-release/Accesswire/covid-health-8dc691a313085db8d208e222ec3d7838"}
