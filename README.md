## Deploying

Make sure you have `docker` and `docker-cli` installed (`docker desktop` should do the job on Windows).

### Production

```shell
TODO: DOCUMENT THIS
```

### Development

No configuration needed. Just execute:

```shell
./dev.ps1
```

Changes on the `Go` backend should always be followed by the re-run of the mentioned command.
