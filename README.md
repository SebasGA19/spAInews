## Deploying

Make sure you have `docker` and `docker-cli` installed (`docker desktop` should do the job on Windows).

### Production

```shell
TODO: DOCUMENT THIS
```

### Development

- Frontend development:

```shell
./dev-back.ps1 # This command may require admin rights
./start-back.ps1
./start-front.ps1
```

- Backend development:

```shell
./dev-back.ps1 # This command may require admin rights
./start-back.ps1
```

On any Go code change re-run:

```shell
./start-back.ps1
```
