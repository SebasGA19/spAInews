The pandemic strengthened the momentum, and now surging inflation has fortified it.The report, produced in conjunction with analytics firm GlobalData, found that 82% of Americans, some 272 million people, are currently buying or selling secondhand goods. A majority of those consumers said inflation impacted their decision to enter the secondhand market, with saving or making money the prime motivation.\"Inflation is more helpful than harmful for resale as it drives the market for both buyers and sellers,\" said Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail.\"On the buyer front, more people are turning to secondhand as a way to save money when prices are high. And more people are selling their used goods to make a bit of extra money,\" he said. \"So inflation is widening the number of people involved in the resale market and expanding the number of items available.\" Last year's backpack: Tapped out families are struggling to pay for back to school purchasesThose who are active in the marketplace are spending about 27 minutes a day on resale sites, almost on par with the 30 minutes a day they spend on Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat.\"We interviewed a representative set of Americans and found that they don't plan on slowing down,\" Dunlap said. \"In fact, more than half (58%) of Americans who engage in recommerce plan to increase their buying and/or selling of pre-owned goods in the next 12 months.\" OfferUp expects the resale market to reach $178 billion in sales in 2022, up from $160 billion from the prior year, and $289 billion in sales by 2027. The report is based on research from GlobalData and a survey of 2,000 US adults conducted in May 2022. ",

Hear why it doesn't work 03:13Washington (CNN)Truth Social, the Twitter-like social network backed by former President Donald Trump, remains unavailable on Google's Android app store because of deficiencies in the app's content moderation systems, according to a Google spokesperson.  The app favored by many of Trump's supporters still has not met the Google Play Store's standards, including policies against incitement and physical threats of violence, the company told CNN on Tuesday.\"On August 19 we notified Truth Social of several violations of standard policies in their current app submission and reiterated that having effective systems for moderating user-generated content is a condition of our terms of service for any app to go live on Google Play,\" the Google spokesperson told CNN. \"Last week, Truth Social wrote back acknowledging our feedback and saying that they are working on addressing these issues.\" Google's statement was first reported by Axios. Although Truth Social has been listed as available for pre-order on the Google Play Store since August 3, the app still has not been officially released, despite Truth Social going live for Apple devices months earlier, in February.  Read MoreIn a media interview posted to YouTube on Friday, Devin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social's parent, the Trump Technology & Media Group, said Truth Social had had \"great success working with Apple; with Google, we're just waiting.\" He added that the decision to list Truth Social is \"up to the Google Play Store\" and that \"we're waiting on them to approve us.\" But Google told CNN that was a distortion, adding that it has clearly communicated how Truth Social still has not met the requirements that would permit the app to be listed for download. Unlike Apple's mobile operating system, which forces users to download apps exclusively from Apple's proprietary app store, Android apps can be downloaded from any source. Truth Social does not appear to be offered through its own website or through third-party app marketplaces. On Tuesday, Trump Technology & Media Group said in a statement it has \"continuously worked in good faith\" with Google. \"TMTG has no desire to litigate its business matters in the public sphere, but for the record, has promptly responded to all inquiries from Google,\" the company said. \"It is our belief that all Americans should have access to Truth Social no matter what devices they use. We look forward to Google approving Truth Social at their earliest convenience.\" ",

It's a strategy known as \"pack and hold.\"\"We're confident that we will be able to integrate our pack and hold inventory with future assortments,\" Gap finance chief Katrina O'Connell said on an earnings call with analysts last week.

Additionally, many shoppers refreshed their wardrobes earlier in the pandemic and don't need another pair of sweatpants or a new look for the office.Retailers don't have unlimited space to store inventory and must decide what to do with their unsold merchandise. Some companies are responding by marking down products and stepping up promotions to try to juice demand. Although discounting helps retailers quickly cut their losses and frees up space to bring in new items, it can also dilute a brand's image.\"Promoting can be cheap today and very expensive tomorrow,\" said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.

They typically pack away basic items that are unlikely to go out of style in the future. But holding onto excess merchandise is expensive, and there's a risk that yesterday's stuff won't sell in future seasons.\"A retailer doesn't want to tie up their inventory dollars in products that aren't moving,\" Siegel said.",

What will replace it?London (CNN Business)First it was the coronavirus pandemic that forced pubs to shut their doors and rely on government support to survive the collapse in business. Now, Britain's iconic watering holes say they are battling an even greater threat: soaring energy prices.The chief executives of six leading pub and brewing businesses are warning that surging bills for electricity, heating and other essential supplies could force many pubs and craft breweries to close, leading to a wave of job losses as the country braces for a recession.\"Across our businesses we are witnessing price rises which are causing irreversible damage,\" they wrote in a letter to the UK government calling for immediate help. \"Hikes can now be upwards of 300% on pre-pandemic energy bills, with the current average increase around 150% across the beer and pub sector, putting jobs and businesses at risk.\"Nick Mackenzie, the head of the Greene King pub chain, said one location it works with reported that energy costs had gone up by \u00a333,000 ($38,744) a year.\"While the government has introduced measures to help households cope with this spike in prices, businesses are having to face this alone, and it is only going to get worse come the autumn,\" Mackenzie said.Graffiti covers a closed-down pub in London.Read MoreSome pubs were being quoted increases of more than 400% in the price of one-year gas supply contracts, while others were finding it impossible to secure contracts at all, said Kevin Georgel, CEO of St Austell Brewery.\"The cost of energy threatens to cause mass business failure and the loss of thousands of pubs across the country,\" he added. The UK energy regulator Ofgem announced last week that bills for households would rise 80% to an average of \u00a33,549 ($4,159) a year from October. CEO Jonathan Brearley said Britain's next prime minister would need to take immediate action when they take office next week to limit the fallout.\"The response will need to match the scale of the crisis we have before us,\" he said.The situation is expected to get worse before it gets better. Energy markets are extremely volatile as traders consider whether Russia could completely cut off gas flows to Europe just as the weather gets cold and more energy is needed. The United Kingdom also has less storage for gas than the rest of Europe, which has been stockpiling supplies.That's stoking alarm about eye-watering costs for households into next year. But businesses say they're not getting enough help either, emphasizing that the crisis will leave many on life support.Just thought I might update you on the latest 'best' energy deal available for a pub of our size.

Many of our members say the eye-watering energy bills could be the final nail in the coffin as they struggle to get through winter,\" he continued.For Britain's pubs, it's another reason to worry about the future. For years, the industry has struggled as people ditch drinking in pubs for bars, restaurants and their homes. Then the pandemic hit, and the government ordered pubs to close for the first time in the country's history. Pubs stayed open during World War I and World War II to boost morale. Now, business conditions are deteriorating again.\"The UK's brewing industry is facing a crisis far graver than that which we faced during the Covid lockdowns of the past few years,\" said Paul Davies, the CEO of British brewer Carlsberg Marstons. He noted that gas and energy costs have nearly tripled since 2019 \u2014 and it's not the only expense to go up. The price of malt, a key ingredient in beer, has doubled, and aluminum costs have jumped more than 50%. Brewers are also worried about supplies of carbon dioxide after one of the biggest UK producers closed a plant because of the soaring cost of energy.There were 39,973 pubs in England and Wales as of June, the lowest level on record and a decline of more than 7,000 locations since 2012, according to an analysis by the Altus Group.The real estate consultancy said that while pubs proved \"remarkably resilient\" during the pandemic, despite deep uncertainty, the energy crisis and inflation are creating \"new headwinds.\"",

The case is currently set to go to trial in the Delaware Chancery Court for five days starting October 17, after a judge ruled that the uncertainty from a dragged-out litigation process threatened \"irreparable harm\" to Twitter (TWTR). But in a Monday court filing, Musk's team proposed a new schedule with the trial taking place sometime in November, depending on the court's availability. Included in the exhibits attached to the motion, one of which was sealed, was a copy of former Twitter head of security and whistleblower Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko's disclosure, which was first reported by CNN and the Washington Post last week.Musk's team has also asked the court for the opportunity to update their counterclaims and response to Twitter's initial complaint, which accuses the billionaire of breaching the agreement and asks a court to compel him to follow through with the deal. Musk cites Twitter whistleblower claims as new justifications for backing out of dealA Twitter spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Business that the company remains \"committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk. We have not breached any of our representations or obligations under the Agreement, and have not suffered and are not likely to suffer a Company Material Adverse Effect.\"Read MoreThe motion to push back the trial comes after Musk on Monday sent a letter to Twitter citing Zatko's disclosure as additional justification for terminating the acquisition. The letter claims that if the allegations are true, Twitter breached its side of the deal. In their earlier move to scrap the deal, Musk and his team accused the company of violating the agreement by lying about the number of bots on its platform and failing to turn over information Musk says he needs to evaluate the issue.Zatko's disclosure alleges, in addition to the company's purported security flaws, that Twitter is in violation of its 2011 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission; that it has violated intellectual property rights; that it lacks incentives to properly measure spam and false accounts on the platform; and that executives have misled the board and regulators. Twitter has criticized Zatko and broadly pushed back against his claims.In response to Musk, Twitter sent its own letter on Tuesday rejecting his latest attempt to scrap the deal, calling it \"invalid and wrongful.\" Musk's letter, Twitter wrote, \"is based solely on statements made by a third party that, as Twitter has previously stated, are riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lack important context.\" The motion to delay is the latest sign of the impact the whistleblower disclosure on the legal battle. Zatko has also been subpoenaed by Musk's legal team and is expected to appear for a deposition on Sept. 9.\"Mr. Zatko will comply with his legal obligations of that subpoena and his appearance at the deposition is involuntary,\" Zatko's attorneys, Debra Katz and Alexis Ronickher, said in a statement Monday. \"He did not make his whistleblower disclosures to the appropriate governmental bodies to benefit Musk or to harm Twitter, but rather to protect the American public and Twitter shareholders.\"Musk lawyer Alex Spiro told CNN last week that they had subpoenaed Zatko in the case even before his whistleblower complaint was made public. In a court hearing in the case last Wednesday, Spiro mentioned Zatko multiple times. Spiro suggested during the hearing that the billionaire's team does not trust Twitter's estimate for spam accounts and monetizable daily active users (mDAU), a key metric it provides to investors, and said Musk's team is requesting information that would allow them to test the measurements.Zatko is also expected to testify at a Senate hearing on September 13.",

As Goldman Sachs and other big firms move in, developers plan a Manhattan-style makeover to Floridas West Palm Beach. (CNN Business)Goldman Sachs will no longer require its non-New York City based employees to get vaccinated for Covid-19, according to a memo obtained by CNN. The Wall Street investment bank told staff in a memo on Tuesday that effective September 6, all employees can enter its offices in the Americas, \"regardless of vaccination status,\" with no requirement to participate in regular testing or wear face coverings. The new Goldman Sachs Covid policy, first reported by the New York Post, does not apply to New York City, which has a vaccine mandate in place. Goldman Sachs, whose headquarters is in Lower Manhattan, said NYC employees without an approved exemption should continue to work remotely. The relaxed Covid protocols from Goldman Sachs show how some businesses are evolving in an effort to live with Covid. \"With many tools including vaccination, improved treatments and testing now available, there is significantly less risk of severe illness,\" Goldman Sachs wrote in the memo, which cited updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that no longer differentiates between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals to define exposure and infections. Read MoreGoldman Sachs in June 2021 became one of the first major companies to call employees back to the office full-time, taking a more aggressive stance than some other employers. Three months later, the bank required employees to get vaccinated.Last December, Goldman Sachs announced plans to require everyone entering its US offices to show proof of Covid vaccination booster shots and the bank mandated testing twice a week. Given the availability of antigen tests, the bank said in the memo it will begin ramping down its supply of test kits at offices. ",

The peaceful demonstration was crushed violently by authorities, with police and plain-clothed security personnel forcefully dispersing protesters.Following the protest, Henan's financial regulator said depositors would be refunded, with the first payments being sent to bank customers with a combined total of less than 50,000 yuan ($7,200) deposited at a single bank. On Monday, the financial authorities said they would launch another round of repayments to customers, this time focusing on those with deposits of between 400,000 yuan ($57,800) and 500,000 yuan ($72,200).Depositors who have lost more would receive an initial sum of 500,000 yuan with the remainder reserved for now, according to the regulators.\"After this round of repayments, the centralized repayment work will be largely completed, and further matters will be dealt with by the four rural banks,\" the statement said.Runs on small Chinese banks have become more frequent in recent years and some have been accused of financial improprieties or corruption. But experts worry that a much bigger financial problem could be looming, caused by fallout from a real estate crash and soaring bad debts related to the Covid-19 pandemic.About a quarter of the total assets in China's banking system are held by around 4,000 small lenders, which often have opaque ownership and governance structures and are more vulnerable to corruption and the sharp economic slowdown.",

According to the company's latest filing with the Mumbai stock exchange, \"the promoter and promoter group\" \u2014 which includes Ambani's wife and children as well as several associated companies \u2014 control nearly 51% of the conglomerate.\"Our next-gen leaders are confidently taking over the reins across businesses,\" Asia's second richest man said at the meeting. While Ambani inherited an oil business from his father two decades ago, he has spent the last few years diversifying into tech, renewable energy and retail. He launched Reliance Jio as a mobile network in 2016. Since then it has amassed over 400 million users and launched a streaming service, a fiber broadband network, a video conferencing app and digital payments.Read MoreReliance Industries is now worth 17.8 trillion rupees ($224 billion), based on its stock market value.\"Akash and Isha have assumed leadership roles in Jio and Retail respectively. They have been passionately involved in our consumer businesses since inception,\" Ambani said. \"Anant has also joined our New Energy business with great zeal.\"Reliance Retail, which was launched in 2006, is India's top retailer by revenue and has over 15,000 stores across the country. They sell everything from smartphones to groceries through various eponymous brands, including Reliance Fresh, Reliance Digital and Reliance Trends. Ambani is the 11th richest man in the world with a fortune of over $90 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The tycoon said Monday that he isn't retiring yet, and will \"continue to provide hands-on leadership.\"While there has been a lot of speculation in India media about who will inherit Ambani's empire, this is the first time he has made an official statement on the roles his children will play during the transition. Bitter feudAmbani's father, Dhirubhai, died in 2002 without a will. His death sparked a bitter feud between Ambani and his younger brother, Anil, for control of the empire.Mukesh Ambani ultimately took over the company's main oil and petrochemicals assets, while his brother assumed control of the newer ventures, including telecom and digital businesses. The brothers' fortunes have gone in vastly different directions since then. Anil, once a billionaire, is no longer part of the elite club, according to the Bloomberg index, and his older brother played a big part in his demise.Mukesh stunned India with the Jio launch, offering customers six months of free high-speed internet. The move triggered a brutal price war, forcing some companies to quit the market altogether, including Anil's Reliance Communications.On Monday, Ambani told shareholders that Jio will invest $25 billion to roll out 5G services across India.\"5G cannot remain an exclusive service, available only to the privileged few, or only to those in our largest cities,\" he said. \"Within the next two months, by Diwali, we will launch Jio 5G across multiple key cities, including the metropolises of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai,\" he said, referring to the Hindu festival in October. The company is also working with Google (GOOGL) to develop \"ultra-affordable 5G smartphones for India,\" Ambani said. Last year, the two companies introduced an entry-level 4G phone in the country. Since inception, Jio \u2014 with its super-cheap data \u2014 has helped bring hundreds of millions of Indians online for the first time. When Ambani launched Jio, India had fewer than 350 million internet users. Now, it has over 750 million.\"We are committed to make India the largest data-powered economy in the world, beating China and the United States,\" Ambani said.On energy, Ambani said that \"Reliance aspires to make India a world leader in new energy manufacturing and a credible alternative to China,\" and plans to invest nearly $10 billion into clean energy manufacturing.",

(CNN Business)Uber is giving riders the ability to connect with a safety agent while taking a nerve-wracking trip, making it the latest feature the company has added in recent years to address safety concerns. The company said the capability is intended to help both riders or drivers in situations that may not warrant calling the police or other emergency assistance. Instead, they'll be connected to a live safety agent from ADT, the security services company, who can monitor their route for the trip's duration.\"You may be feeling uncomfortable on a ride \u2014 and that's different for every person,\" Uber's lead safety product manager, Rebecca Payne, told CNN Business, citing examples such as a rider traveling through a neighborhood they're unfamiliar with, or a driver running out of gas or dealing with customers who don't want to follow Uber's policies.\"It's able to give them a third-party that can help them mediate, or guide them through a situation like that,\" said Payne, noting that the ADT agent can communicate with the rider or driver by text or phone, and can also contact 911 should the situation escalate. ADT has access to the trip information once a user opts to connect with an agent, including the vehicle license plate and GPS location.Lyft has offered the live-agent feature in partnership with ADT for a few years. Uber said it has been quietly piloting the capability in nine cities in recent months before making it available nationwide this week. Read MoreLeah Page, vice president of emerging business and mobile security at ADT, told CNN Business that it has \"thousands and thousands of US-based agents\" to help respond to requests. The update comes as part of a broader safety update announced Tuesday, including a redesigned \"toolkit\" to make it easier to find the various safety features, such as setting up \"trusted contacts\" to easily share trip information with friends or family. There's also a \"pin code\" feature in which a passenger must verbally provide a four-digit pin code to the driver to verify they are taking the correct vehicle. Uber is also expanding its \"text to 911\" feature, making it now available in nearly 60% of the United States, Uber said, including in California and New York City.Uber, for years, has said that safety is its top priority as it aims to help people feel comfortable using its service in the face of reports around issues like sexual harassment and assault by drivers. Uber, followed by Lyft, initially pledged to share data on its most severe safety incidents in response to a 2018 CNN investigation into drivers accused of sexual assault or abuse by passengers since 2014, based on publicly available data including police reports.Across the two safety reports it has since published, which cover 2017 to 2020, Uber disclosed that it received 9,805 reports of the most severe categories of sexual assault, which range from \"non-consensual kissing of a non-sexual body part\" to \"non-consensual sexual penetration,\" or rape. Uber, on its website, notes \"as the numbers in both reports show, critical safety incidents on our platform are, statistically, extremely rare.\"Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) each face a number of lawsuits stemming from individual assault claims. Put together, they allege the companies didn't make clear the known risks and failed to do more to protect riders. Attorneys representing some of the alleged victims have said requiring recordings of trips may help prevent future incidents.In late 2019, Uber began testing an audio recording feature in Brazil and Mexico. It has since expanded the feature across Latin America, and announced in December it was piloting the capability in three US cities.Payne told CNN Business the company is \"definitely excited about\" the feature, which is not required, and noted that it has to carefully consider privacy laws concerning recordings and consent, which vary depending on the state. So far, Payne said that usage of the feature where available is \"quite low ... where people are only using it, maybe in the midst of a safety incident, and not recording the whole trip.\" \"What we want to try and do is see if we can encourage more people to record their entire trip, just in case,\" added Payne.",

(CNN)Russian energy giant Gazprom said on Tuesday that it will completely suspend gas supplies to French industrial energy group Engie this week due to a contract dispute, amid concerns of a potential energy crisis in Europe this winter.  In a statement on its official Telegram channel, Gazprom said: \"At the close of the business day on August 30, Gazprom Export did not receive full payment for gas supplied to Engie (France) in July under the existing contracts.\"  The Gazprom statement added that Russian law prohibits the country's natural gas suppliers to supply further deliveries of gas to foreign buyers if payment has not been made in full by the buyer within the contractual term.  Gazprom added that it has notified Engie of a complete suspension of gas deliveries beginning September 1 until full payment for the gas supplied has been received.  The announcement came just hours after Gazprom said it would reduce its supply of gas to France.Read MoreThe decrease in supply is \"due to a disagreement between the parties on the application of contracts,\" Engie said in a statement earlier Tuesday.\"This reduction is the logical continuation of the actions of Gazprom for several months, which does not respect its contracts, and which reduces its supplies to most of its customers,\" a source inside the cabinet of the French energy ministry told CNN, adding that Gazprom's actions did not compromise the security of France's supply.Engie also said a Gazprom reduction would not affect supply. The company had \"already secured the necessary volumes to ensure the supply of its customers and of its own needs\" and it has implemented a series of \"measures to significantly reduce the direct financial and physical impacts that could result from an interruption of gas deliveries by Gazprom,\" it said.Engie did not respond immediately to CNN's request for comment on the complete suspension.Pierre Bairin and Ren\u00e9e Bertini in Paris contributed reporting.",

All businesses in the affected areas are shut down through Thursday, except for supermarkets, pharmacies and hospitals. Restaurant dining is also suspended, with only takeaways allowed.China is one of the last places in the world still enforcing stringent zero-Covid measures, which rely on sweeping digital surveillance, mass testing, extensive quarantines and snap lockdowns.Read MoreOn Tuesday, Shenzhen, an international technology hub of 18 million people, reported just 35 infections, including 11 asymptomatic cases. The heavy-handed approach has seen dozens of neighborhoods across Shenzhen identified as \"high-risk areas,\" and placed under strict lockdown orders. Videos shared by residents on social media show metal barriers -- some topped with barbed wire -- erected outside residential buildings, blocking residents from leaving.The districts of Luohu and Longgang also shut down all entertainment venues and public parks, and banned gatherings from conferences and performances to square dancing.Authorities also suspended service at 24 subway stations and hundreds of bus stations across Shenzhen, including around the Huaqiangbei electronics market.At a news conference Monday, Shenzhen officials said the outbreak is mainly driven by new subvariant Omicron BF.15, which they said is more transmittable and harder to detect.\"The upcoming period will be the most stressful, high-risk and grim period for epidemic prevention and control in our city,\" a Shenzhen official told the news conference.The Huaqiangbei shopping area in Shenzhen is home to the world's largest eletronics wholesale market.Outbreaks across ChinaChina's zero-Covid strategy has faced growing challenges from the highly infectious Omicron variant, with large swathes of the country subject to rolling lockdowns and daily testing.

(CNN Business)A television commercial for a male body spray has been taken off the air in India, after critics said it made light of gang rape.Bollywood celebrities including Priyanka Chopra, Richa Chadha and Farhan Akhtar are among those to have lambasted the commercial for Layer'r Shot, a brand of male fragrance, calling it \"shameful,\" \"disgusting\" and \"incredibly tasteless.\"Its controversial advert shows four men appearing to stalk a frightened-looking woman in a store before cutting to one of the men saying, \"We're four, there's one, who takes the shot?\"Only when the woman turns round does it become clear they are talking about the body spray -- which one of the men then takes from a store shelf and uses.The commercial caused a storm on social media, where critics including various celebrities blasted its innuendo as making light of rape. Read MoreMany said the timing of the advert made it particularly insensitive, as it was broadcast just a week after a case in which a 17-year-old was allegedly raped by five men in the southern city of Hyderabad -- the latest in a series of high-profile crimes against women and minority groups across the country.\"This advertisement is clearly promoting sexual violence against women and girls and promoting a rapist mentality among men. The advertisement is cringeworthy and should not be allowed to be played on mass media,\" wrote Swati Maliwal, chairwoman of the Delhi Commission for Women, to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Saturday. Indian actress Priyanka Chopra, who called the ad \"shameful and disgusting\".Within 24 hours, the ministry had taken the commercial off the air and asked Twitter and YouTube to remove it from their platforms.In an email to Twitter, the ministry said the videos were \"detrimental to the portrayal of women in the interest of decency and morality\" and violated the digital media ethics code.In a statement Monday, Layer'r Shot apologized for the television advertisement, saying it \"never intended to hurt anyone's sentiments or feelings or outrage any woman's modesty or promote any sort of culture, as wrongly perceived by some.\"The brand said it had voluntarily asked all its media partners to stop broadcasting variations of the advertisement from Saturday with immediate effect.Even after the commercial was taken down, it continued to cause a controversy. Actress Richa Chadha was among those registering her disgust, calling the makers of the commercial \"filth.\"Deadly rape of Indian woman has 'shaken the nation once again'\"Creatives, script, agency, client, casting... does everyone think rape is a joke?,\" Chadha tweeted. Responding to Chadha's Tweet, Quantico star Priyanka Chopra called the ad \"shameful and disgusting\" and said she was glad that the ministry has taken it down.Film writer and director Farhan Akhtar also slammed the advertisement.\"What incredibly tasteless and twisted minds it must take to think up, approve and create these stinking body spray 'gang rape' innuendo ads. Shameful,\" tweeted Akhtar, who is also a United Nations Women's Goodwill Ambassador.Actress Swara Bhasker said both the perfume brand and its marketing agency had been \"tone deaf\" given the alleged gang rape of the teenager in an upscale part of Hyderabad last Saturday. The case has shocked the state of Telangana, of which Hyderabad is the capital. Telangana's home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali said on Saturday that \"strong action will be taken against all the offenders, irrespective of their background.\" It was \"a ghastly incident,\" the minister tweeted on Saturday.An earlier version of this story gave the wrong last name for UN Women's Goodwill Ambassador Farhan Akhtar  Additional reporting by CNN's Esha Mitra",

India ranked second behind only Vietnam last year in a list of countries seeing the fastest growth in cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report published in October by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.While the government does not keep estimates of how many people trade cryptocurrencies, industry experts have suggested that the country may now have more than 20 million crypto investors. The growth is driven by younger investors \u2014 mostly under the age of 35 \u2014 and many of them are coming from smaller cities and towns, founders of two of India's biggest crypto exchanges told CNN Business. According to Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of exchange CoinDCX, many Indian millennials have started \"their investing journey with crypto.\"While 20 years ago, their parents chose to invest in gold, these youngsters \"are more interested in having bitcoin as part of their portfolio,\" Gupta told CNN Business, referring to the fact that traditionally Indians chose to park their money in gold or savings accounts. Buying gold is both an investment and a cultural habit in India, which is one of the largest markets for the precious metal, according to the World Gold Council. It also considered auspicious by Hindus and Jains, and plays a fundamental role in many religious ceremonies.Mumbai-based CoinDCX became India's first crypto unicorn last year, achieving a valuation of $1.1 billion after raising money from investors such as Coinbase Ventures and B Capital Group. The company says 70% of its 10 million users are between the age of 18 and 34. The CoinDCX app is seen on a phone screen in West Bengal, India, in August 2021.Data shared by rival firm WazirX tell a similar story. WazirX also has over 10 million users, and called 2021 a \"phenomenal year\" for crypto trading in India. The company was acquired by Binance, one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, in 2019.Over 65% of its users are under the age of 35, according to a recent company report, and it has seen a \"700% increase in the number of participants from smaller cities like Guwahati, Karnal, Bareilly, thereby signaling the growing interest from rural and semi-urban areas.\" Pritish Kumawat, a crypto trader from a small town in the western state of Rajasthan, said that he now finds conversations about cryptocurrencies in almost every tea shop in his area. Often, the most engaged participants are college students, he said, adding that bitcoin's massive spike last year has fueled the frenzy in India. In November, bitcoin was trading at a record high of $68,990, but it has since fallen to around $43,000. In addition to bitcoin, meme currencies such as dogecoin and shiba inu are also popular among Indians, the WazirX report added. Apart from investors from smaller towns, both companies saw an increase of more than 1000% in the number of women users on their platforms, albeit on a small base.Gupta said that participation of crypto by Indian women has seen \"a massive upside\" in the past 18 months and is \"fairly high, fairly healthy, relative to equity markets.\" The company's data shows that 15% of their overall users are women \u2014 which is the global trend as well.On-again, off-again relationshipThe excitement over crypto is rising in India despite the country's on-again, off-again relationship with digital currencies. The central bank has long expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism. A cryptically worded proposal posted on the Indian parliament website last year even suggested the government was exploring plans to \"prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India.\"This year, however, started on a more cheerful note for enthusiasts. Earlier this month, the Indian government announced it would impose a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets, which many industry experts took as a sign that crypto trading won't be banned after all. The government also said it would launch a digital rupee in the coming months. \"Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction. It gives much-needed clarity and confidence to the industry,\" Gupta said at the time of the announcement.Siddharth Menon, the co-founder of WazirX, told CNN Business that following the announcement, his platform saw daily sign-ups jump by over 50%. He also noticed rising interest among Indian developers and other professionals in joining the crypto industry. WazirX's website is shown in New York, USA, in April 2021.\"I'm getting LinkedIn messages\" from senior executives in India, who are now more optimistic about the business, he said. In the past, Indian exchanges have struggled to hire and retain experienced people due to the lack of clear regulations. But the Indian government soon put a damper on the mood, by clarifying that the cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in the country.\"I am not doing anything to legalize it or ban it or not legalize it,\" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in parliament a few days after announcing the tax rate. \"Banning or not banning will come subsequently ... But I will tax because it is a sovereign right.\" \"I think the government is not entirely sure what it wants to do from a policy perspective,\" said Anirudh Rastogi, founder of tech law firm Ikigaw Law, which works with crypto exchanges in India.\"It knows where it wants to land broadly. It wants to find the right balance where it is not disconnected from the global progress in blockchain and other tech, but it wants to also address concerns regarding cryptocurrency.\"Rastogi added that the \"extraordinarily high\" tax on crypto is a short-term fix, which will also acts as a deterrent to many investors. \"This rate is typically used to tax activities that are not considered economically productive, such as lottery,\" he said. \"So this could be an indication that the government wants to make revenue, but it does not see crypto trading as economically productive.\"For equities, India applies a 15% short-term capital gains tax if shares are sold in less than a year, and 10% if sold after a year.Gupta hopes that the government makes up its mind soon. India, with its vast pool of developers and enthusiastic young population, could be a \"superpower in the next five to 10 years,\" in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, he said. \"What is missing right now is a clear regulatory framework,\" he added.",

His plans went awryBy Diksha Madhok, CNN BusinessUpdated 0838 GMT (1638 HKT) November 4, 2021As Covid-19 wreaked havoc around the world last year, the 39-year-old son of an Indian billionaire was laying the groundwork for a plan he hoped would eventually end the pandemic.Adar Poonawalla \u2014 the CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker \u2014 pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his Indian manufacturing facility and committed to make millions of doses of a then-unproven coronavirus vaccine. That vaccine, created by Oxford University and AstraZeneca (AZN), was still in clinical trials at the time. Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work. \"It was a calculated risk,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business. \"But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.\"Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, chose to commit to making a vaccine while it was still in clinical trials.To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet's most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal. Read MoreAs the world gave its money \u2014 and trust \u2014 to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India. \"It was a calculated risk. But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.\"SII CEO Adar Poonawalla, on committing his company to make millions of doses of a then-unproven Covid vaccineBut soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. His company's ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He's also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations \u2014 the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer. From horse breeders to vaccine makersIt's easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla. Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company \u2014 which was founded by Poonawalla's father, Cyrus, 55 years ago \u2014 produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world's babies depend on vaccines made at SII. The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world's preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century.Cyrus Poonawalla is now India's seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in international markets. To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune. More than $250 million came from the company's own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which SII collaborated with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid by other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance.All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would \"just be making batches and then end up throwing them away,\" Poonawalla said.Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on materials including chemicals and glass vials to prepare for vaccine production.A business studies graduate of London's University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business. \"The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this,\" said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished Airbus A320. After UK regulators approved the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII. India's Covid-19 tsunamiBut Poonawalla's plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over 400,000 cases per day, though experts say the actual number was likely much higher. At that point, only 2% percent of India's 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country's national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had.India then decided to stop the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere.A brutal second wave of Covid-19 hit India in spring 2021.\"I've always been a patriot for my country ... and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say,\" Poonawalla said. \"There was no two ways about that.\"The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa's disease control body, for example, warned India's hold on exports could be \"catastrophic\" for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to Kenya, were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine.When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options. At the start of 2021, \"very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment,\" the spokesperson said, adding that it was \"natural\" that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size. But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan. \"Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight,\" said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.Being held to accountWhile Poonawalla cannot be held responsible for some of the issues that led to the vaccine rollout stalling \u2014 chief among them, India's massive outbreak \u2014 his detractors have questioned parts of his approach. They point out Poonawalla hasn't delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn't been transparent about how he's been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push.\"There isn't much accountability for where the money he raised went,\" Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business. In June last year, SII pledged it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020. But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just 70 million doses. His critics weren't impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year. SII declined to comment on the amount it has made from its vaccine production so far. Poonawalla called it \"very unreasonable and naive\" for people to expect companies not to profit from these efforts.The global media coverage also turned unfavorable, with headlines linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII's problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company's Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had no effect on Covishield production. But he has since reversed course, saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing.He also insists he was realistic about his goals. \"We always underpromise,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver. Still, he's been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India's Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a \"philanthropic gesture\" \u2014 leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII.\"AstraZeneca has pledged that it won't make profits from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII,\" Aisola said. According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices. SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a \"very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world\" for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine. While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered one billion doses by October \u2014 about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company.SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October. SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It's also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine.",

And yet the impact on the economy at large is likely to be so tiny that it will be hard to measure.Biden announced Wednesday that his administration will forgive $10,000 for borrowers who make less than $125,000 per year. Low-income borrowers who went to college on Pell Grants will receive up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness.This debt relief will give tens of millions of borrowers some breathing room at a time when the cost of living has skyrocketed.Critically, the cancellation of student debt is being paired with a plan to lift the freeze on federal student debt payments, beginning in January 2023. That means many Americans who haven't had to pay down student loans since March 2020 will have to begin doing so, eating into their cash flows.Despite fears that Biden's student debt relief will fuel already-crippling inflation, economists say the combined impact will be minimal on the economy at large. Read More\"The end of the moratorium will weigh on growth and inflation, while the debt forgiveness will support growth and inflation,\" Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told CNN. \"The net of these cross-currents is largely a wash.\"Biden announces student loan forgiveness planMoody's estimates that the combined impact will reduce real GDP in 2023 by 0.05 percentage points, drive down unemployment by 0.02 percentage points and cut inflation by 0.03 percentage points. In other words, a very tiny effect.\"We're not talking about raising or lowering inflation by a percentage point or even a half a percentage point. We're talking about a really small impact,\" Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CNN in a phone interview. \"But for individuals this makes a big difference. It wipes out more than half the debt for more than half the borrowers. That's a big deal.\"Tens of millions of borrowers impactedThe typical undergraduate student with loans graduates with nearly $25,000 in debt, according to a Department of Education analysis cited by the White House. Up to 43 million borrowers will receive relief from Biden's student debt plan, including eliminating the full remaining balance for about 20 million borrowers, according to the White House. How to qualify for Biden's new student loan forgiveness planThe inflationary impact would have been larger if Biden did not impose an income threshold on the debt relief or if he heeded calls from some progressives to wipe out $50,000 in student debt. Baker praised Biden's plan as a \"good compromise\" that avoided going to extremes.\"It's helping people out, but not giving away the store,\" he said.Some groups, including the NAACP, argue Biden's debt relief doesn't go far enough given the mountain of student debt in America. \"Canceling just $10,000 of debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire,\" NAACP leaders wrote in a CNN Business opinion piece.JUST WATCHEDBiden forgave $10K in student debt. People flooded TikTok with their reactionsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBiden forgave $10K in student debt. People flooded TikTok with their reactions 02:08A $300 billion price tagOf course, there is a cost to canceling student debt. And that cost will be picked up by taxpayers just when deficit reduction had suddenly become a bipartisan trend in Washington.A one-time cancellation of $10,000 for each borrower earning less than $125,000 will cost the government approximately $300 billion, according to an estimate this week from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. (The Penn Wharton model did not include the cost of wiping out up to $20,000 in student debt for Pell Grant recipients). Although $300 billion isn't massive for a $25 trillion economy, the cost of the student debt forgiveness would cancel out the projected federal budget deficit savings from the just-passed Inflation Reduction Act. \"All the deficit reduction will be wiped out,\" Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told CNN's Poppy Harlow. Note that the White House has hailed the deficit reduction aspect of the Inflation Reduction Act as an important inflation-fighting measure. And this marked a significant shift after years of both parties adding to America's mountain of debt to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.Even Jason Furman, head of the Council of Economic Advisers for former President Barack Obama, has doubts about Biden's plan.\"Pouring roughly half trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless,\" Furman tweeted. \"Doing it while going well beyond one campaign promise ($10K of student loan relief) and breaking another (all proposals paid for) is even worse.\"Still, said Zandi of Moody's, this is a \"big positive deal for probably close to 40 million, mostly lower and middle income, Americans, but [a] small negative deal for all American taxpayers.\" 'Sends the wrong message'Beyond the economic impact, Biden's plan has sparked questions about fairness because it only helps people who were fortunate enough to go to college. Rep. Tim Ryan, the Ohio Senate Democratic nominee, said Biden's decision on student debt \"sends the wrong message to the millions of Ohioans without a degree working just as hard to make ends meet.\"\"Instead of forgiving student loans for six-figure earners, we should be working to level the playing field for all Americans,\" Ryan said.Citing a Department of Education analysis, the White House said nearly 90% of relief dollars will go to those earning less than $75,000. The student debt forgiveness comes too late for borrowers who worked for years to pay off their loans, only to now see others have their debt wiped away. \"I take that very seriously,\" Baker said of the fairness concerns. \"We're relieving $10,000, not $50,000 or $100,000. That's why $10,000 is a good number.\"JUST WATCHED'Give me an f-ing break': Commentators debate Biden's student debt forgiveness planReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Give me an f-ing break': Commentators debate Biden's student debt forgiveness plan 01:53The real problem continuesNo matter the amount, wiping out student loan debt doesn't address the underlying problem: College tuition is way too expensive.Between 2000 and 2021, the cost of college tuition increased at more than twice the pace of overall inflation, according to Moody's Analytics. That's despite a slowdown in tuition hikes during Covid.The basket of goods measured in the Consumer Price Index cost 57% more in 2021 than it did in 2000, while the cost of college tuition soared by 167%, Moody's said. It's hard to see how eliminating a chunk of student debt solves that issue. And some, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, have warned debt relief could also help raise tuitions. \"Costs are out of control. It's absurd people have to borrow large amounts and then struggle to pay it back,\" said Baker. \"That problem is unsolved.\"",

But whatever your opinion is on Biden's motives, a couple of things seem clear. First: Relieving up to $20,000 in student debt per borrower is a financial tourniquet that will help 43 million people who've been swept into a complex and undeniably broken system. Second: It doesn't even begin to solve the problem. Once the debt is wiped away, what we're left with is the gnarly reality that tuition costs are out of control, with no magic bullet to rein them in.Paying for collegeIt's not breaking news that college costs have skyrocketed. One year at a private college now costs $38,070 on average; a year at a public university costs $10,740 \u2014 or much more for out-of-state students. Read MoreThe economics behind tuition costs are complicated and vary by institution. Some states, such as Louisiana and Arizona, have pulled money out of their own public higher education systems, forcing colleges to raise tuition and let federal loans make up the gap. But not all states, says Kevin Carey, vice president of education policy at the think tank New America. In some cases, tuition has risen in step with inflation and population growth. What feeds tuition inflation has more to do with the scale of the higher education system. The United States has a massive decentralized system of hundreds of nonprofit colleges, where the national government does not control prices. The country also has a large upper middle class that's willing to pay top dollar for their children's education. Every one of those institutions is competing for talent. And for funding. Put simply: \"There's nothing about the system that pushes prices down,\" Carey says. \"Everything pushes them up.\"That's why some critics of the Biden administration's student debt relief worry about the precedent it sets. If the government creates an expectation that debts are likely to be forgiven, universities won't hesitate to raise tuition. Students may take on more debt, expecting some of it will eventually be wiped clean. Bottom line, canceling debt certainly doesn't push tuition costs down. Other ways to deal with debtSome critics of the Biden plan have suggested a better solution would be to treat student loan debt like any other consumer debt: Let the bankruptcy courts handle it. Right now, it's not impossible to offload student loan debt via bankruptcy, but it's much more difficult than, say, credit card debt.  \"The typical American can go to court, declare himself insolvent, hand over some remaining assets, default on his remaining debts and return home to a house exempted from the proceedings,\" wrote Oren Cass, executive director of the conservative think tank American Compass, in an opinion essay for Politico. \"This is the option that should be available to all student-loan holders.\"While that's not a simple or painless solution \u2014 bankruptcy carries very real financial consequences and social stigmas that make it a last resort \u2014 Cass argues the cost is low enough to \"ensure someone who truly needs a fresh start can get one, but high enough that most who can avoid it will do what they can to steer clear.\"Good luck, class of 2028For better or worse, the bachelor's degree remains deeply embedded in the corporate hiring process. And in recent decades, many fields such as nursing have evolved to require a series of extra certifications requiring further education (and, of course, more student loans). The bachelor's degree has become the new standard, Carey says. \"And then there are all these post-bachelor's degrees, credentials and certifications \u2014 all that stuff is controlled by colleges... and paid for through loans.\" Another flaw in Biden's plan that critics point to is the lack of clarity about future loan forgiveness. If you just graduated with debt and make under $125,000 a year, congratulations \u2014 now you've got 10 grand less of it. But younger generations whose student loans were taken out after the July 2022 cutoff could be out of luck. \"The class of '27 is entering college literally as we speak,\" Carey says. \"They're not getting any loan relief. I think people are going to start raising their hands and be like, 'wait, what?'\" ",

    "maintext": "Mikhail Gorbachev during an official visit to Bulgaria in 1985. He died Tuesday at the age of 91.TASS via Getty ImagesMikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev, the Soviet Union\u2019s last leader, died Tuesday at the age of 91. His death followed \u201ca severe and prolonged illness,\u201d Moscow\u2019s Central Clinical Hospital told state-owned Russian news agency RIA Novosti, per CNN. The Associated Press cited other Russian news agencies TASS and Interfax as similarly reporting that Gorbachev had died.Gorbachev, who served as general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1985 until 1991, was a controversial figure in his lifetime.Advertisement\n\nCelebrated in the West for dismantling the Iron Curtain, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 for brokering international peace and helping to end the Cold War. In his native Russia, however, Gorbachev was reviled by many for presiding over the collapse of the Soviet Union. \u201cI feel like a man who has lived several lives, full of great moments and heavy losses,\u201d Gorbachev once said.Though he expressed regret for some political choices, Gorbachev stood by many of the Cold War decisions that have earned him a place in history.Perestroika, the program of political and economic reform that he introduced in the USSR in the mid-1980s, was one of his greatest achievements, he told The Guardian in a 2011 interview.Advertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we were able to achieve within the country and in the international arena was of enormous importance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt predetermined the course of events in ending the Cold War, moving toward a new world order and, in spite of everything, producing gradual movement away from a totalitarian state to a democracy.\u201dGorbachev was born on March 2, 1931, in the southern Russian province of Stavropol to a peasant Ukrainian-Russian family.His childhood was marked by suffering and terror. In the 1932-33 Soviet famine, nearly half his village starved to death, including members of his own family. Many more in the village were later killed during Joseph Stalin\u2019s purges. In 1937, one of Gorbachev\u2019s grandfathers was captured and tortured. \u201cThey tried to break his arms,\u201d Gorbachev remembered. \u201cThey tried to blind him.\u201dStill, for all the hardship, Gorbachev was remembered by his classmates and teachers as a bright and popular child who enjoyed singing and dancing. As a teen, he helped his father operate combine harvesters on collective farms.He was one of \u201cbest looking guys in the village,\u201d his childhood friend, Alexander Yakovenko, remembered in \u201cA Man Who Changed The World,\u201d a documentary about Gorbachev\u2019s life.Advertisement\n\nIn 1950, Gorbachev left Stavropol to study law in the capital. \u201cHe was the only one of us who went to Moscow,\u201d his classmate Raisa Kopeikina recalled in the documentary. \u201cAnd that was at a time when people here hardly knew what the trains even looked like. He went to Moscow State University \u2014 a simple chap from a faraway village.\u201dWhile at university, Gorbachev became active in the Communist Party, sparking what would become a decades-long career in politics.\u201cI liked the communist ideals \u2014 freedom, equality, justice, a good life,\u201d he said later. \u201cEverything that was in the party program, everything that was proclaimed by [party] leaders, we took it at face value.\u201dIt was also in college that he met the love of his life, Raisa Titarenko. The couple married in September 1953 and had a daughter, Irina, a few years later.Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev during his first visit to London in 1984.Bryn Colton via Getty ImagesAdvertisement\n\nUpon graduation, Gorbachev returned to Stavropol and began work as a provincial Communist Party official. In the decades that followed, he steadily rose through the ranks of the party. He was an ambitious careerist who made friends in the right places. Thanks in part to his connections and also his own hard work, Gorbachev was called to Moscow in the late 1970s and later promoted to the Soviet Union\u2019s executive committee, the Politburo. Then in 1985, after the deaths of three leaders in four years, including his mentor Yuri Andropov, Gorbachev was appointed the head of the USSR.Gorbachev, then 54, inherited a Soviet Union in desperate need of reform. The nation had suffered from years of economic and political stagnation. It needed a change-maker \u2014 a role Gorbachev was prepared to fill.Soon after taking power, Gorbachev, affectionately referred to as \u201cGorby,\u201d unveiled his bold plans to revitalize the Soviet Union. Perestroika (a program of restructuring) and glasnost (loosely translated as \u201copenness\u201d) were cornerstones of his vision. He relaxed bureaucracy and censorship in the hopes of promoting modernity and democracy. He started a dialogue with then-President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration, the beginnings of a thaw after decades of Cold War.Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan and former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev.Steve Granitz via Getty ImagesAdvertisement\n\nGorbachev was determined to foster d\u00e9tente with the U.S., and after a series of meetings with Reagan, agreed to pull the plug on the long-running nuclear arms race. In 1987, the two world leaders signed a historic treaty agreeing to shrink their ground-based nuclear arsenals.Reagan described the accord as the realization of \u201can impossible vision.\u201d The U.S. president would later give Gorbachev \u201cmost of the credit\u201d for ending the arms race.In 1990, Gorbachev received the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in promoting international peace. \u201c[We] want to honor Mikhail Gorbachev for his many and decisive contributions,\u201d the Nobel Committee said at the time. \u201cThe greater openness he has brought about in Soviet society has also helped promote international trust.\u201d But though Gorbachev\u2019s foreign policy reforms were applauded in the West, things at home weren\u2019t going quite so smoothly.\u201cI am often asked whether my fellow leaders of perestroika and I knew the full scope of what we had to do,\u201d Gorbachev wrote in 2013. He went on:Advertisement\n\n The answer is yes and no \u2015 not fully and not immediately. What we had to abandon was quite clear: the rigid ideological, political and economic system; the confrontation with much of the rest of the world; and the unbridled arms race. It is much more difficult to answer the follow-up question: What were our goals, what did we want to achieve? We came a long way in a short time \u2014 moving from trying to repair the existing system to recognizing the need to replace it. Yet I always adhered to my choice of evolutionary change \u2014 moving deliberately so that we would not break the backs of the people and the country and would avoid bloodshed. Gorbachev tried to broker peace with the U.S. while attempting to challenge an entrenched social and political system at home, where unrest began to bubble over.Radicals felt change was coming too slowly, and Gorbachev\u2019s communist compatriots believed he was compromising too much too quickly. Economically, the country continued to flounder and emboldened, by Gorbachev\u2019s policy of glasnost and unwillingness to use military power, several Soviet republics, including Ukraine and Lithuania, began to wrest their independence from communist rule.In 1991, hardline members in the Communist Party imprisoned Gorbachev in his holiday home in Crimea, and attempted to overthrow him and roll back his reforms.Mikhail Gorbachev and his family returning to Moscow after spending three days under house arrest in 1991. Getty ImagesAdvertisement\n\nThe coup was unsuccessful, undermined in part by the efforts of Boris Yeltsin, one of Gorbachev\u2019s fiercest political opponents.Yeltsin had won the hearts of the people, and soon went about dismantling what was left of the communist government.Recognizing Yeltsin\u2019s increasing popularity and the impending dissolution of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev resigned as president on Dec. 25, 1991, marking the end of the USSR.\u201cWe\u2019re now living in a new world,\u201d Gorbachev said in a somber but brief address to the nation.In later interviews, Gorbachev said he deeply regretted waiting \u201ctoo long in trying to reform the Communist Party.\u201d He should have resigned earlier, he said, and formed a new democratic reform party.\u201cI now think I \u2026 should have insisted on resigning from the Communist Party. It had become a brake on reforms even though it had launched them. But they all thought the reforms only needed to be cosmetic. They thought that painting the facade was enough, when actually there was still the same old mess inside the building,\u201d he said in The Guardian interview in 2011. He added that he also regretted not giving more power to the Soviet republics when he had an opportunity to do so.Advertisement\n\nIn the years after the USSR\u2019s collapse, Gorbachev was ridiculed by Yeltsin, the first president of the Russian Federation, and became one of Russia\u2019s most hated figures.But Gorbachev said he had prepared himself for the disgrace.\u201cAfter I left the Kremlin, I had no illusions: It was going to be difficult, hard,\u201d he said in 2016. \u201cAs the economy\u2019s problems worsened, it was wholly predictable that the politicians would be looking for a scapegoat. I was the perfect candidate. A deluge of lies and slander rained down on me.\u201dThe support of his wife, family and friends buoyed his spirits during those dark days, he said, as well did his continued belief in the mechanisms of change he\u2019d implemented.\u201cAbove all, what kept me going was the certainty that perestroika had been essential and that, having taken on a far from easy burden, we were bearing it with dignity,\u201d he said. \u201cFor all the mistakes and failures, we had led our country out of a historical impasse, given it a first experience of freedom, emancipated our people and given them back the right to think for themselves. We had ended the Cold War and nuclear arms race.\u201dGorbachev, described by his friends as an optimist and moralist, would attempt to return to politics many times in his later years, but was ultimately unsuccessful in making a mark.Advertisement\n\nHe founded the Gorbachev Foundation, a think tank focused on Russian history and politics, and the environmental organization Green Cross International.In 1999, Gorbachev suffered what he described as the \u201cgreatest loss\u201d of his life: the death of his wife, Raisa, from leukemia.\u201cThe overwhelming grief of the former Soviet president was visible to everyone present, and the formality of the occasion was softened by a sense of shared sadness,\u201d the Guardian reported from her funereal.Just before her coffin was lowered into a grave, Gorbachev \u201cabandoned his attempt to retain his composure, and wept. Whispering something to his wife, he stroked her face and hair.:\u201cI am very lucky with Mikhail,\u201d Raisa was quoted as saying in 1985. \u201cWe are really friends.\u201dGorbachev says goodbye to his wife at her funeral in 1999.Getty ImagesAdvertisement\n\nUntil his dying day, Gorbachev remained a divisive figure in Russia. He\u2019s been called \u201cthe greatest figure in 20th century history,\u201d and also a traitor to his country.\u201cSome love him for bringing freedom, and others loathe him for bringing freedom,\u201d Dmitri Muratov, a Russian newspaper editor, told The New York Times in 2016.In 2014, several members of Russia\u2019s parliament called for Gorbachev to be prosecuted over the collapse of the Soviet Union. Vladimir Pekhtin, a close ally of current Russian President Vladimir Putin, once called Gorbachev a \u201cdemagogue and traitor.\u201d Yeltsin\u2019s Vice President Alexander Rutskoi dubbed him \u201cthe man who betrayed his country and his people.\u201dBut Gorbachev was never one to remain silent, despite potential censure. In his later years, he was a vocal opponent of some of Putin\u2019s policies. He said in 2016 that Putin had become an \u201cobstacle to progress\u201d in Russia. \u201cIt is crucial that people should trust the president and be able to believe him. Yes, Russia needs a strong leader, but not a F\u00fchrer, not a Stalin,\u201d he wrote at the time.Advertisement\n\nGorbachev is survived by his daughter, Irina, and his two granddaughters, Ksenya and Anastasya.",

    "maintext": "When Maine voters went to the polls last November, their ballots asked them to decide whether the state should prohibit construction on the Central Maine Power Company\u2019s $1 billion transmission line from Canada. Nearly 60% said yes, retroactively blocking a project that state regulators had already approved.On Tuesday, Maine\u2019s high court ruled that the referendum may have violated the utility company\u2019s right to build, throwing the New England Clean Energy Connect a lifeline that could reverse the fate of a controversial project \u2015 one that experts nevertheless say is vital to weaning the United States\u2019 gas-dependent Northeast off fossil fuels.The ballot initiative\u2019s language retroactively targeting the line \u201cwould infringe\u201d on the project\u2019s \u201cconstitutionally-protected vested rights\u201d if the company \u201ccan demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that it engaged in substantial construction of the project in good-faith reliance on the authority granted by the permit before Maine voters approved the initiated bill by public referendum,\u201d the Maine Supreme Judicial Court wrote in its ruling.Advertisement\n\nCMP will need to prove its case before a lower court. It\u2019s unclear when those proceedings may begin. But a victory there would likely lead to construction resuming on the partially built line, assuming it comes before the end of 2023 \u2015 after which Massachusetts, which is paying for the power line, says it will seek alternatives.A partially completed tower and a finished tower are seen in a section of the transmission line along Route 201 in Bingham, Maine, last November.Portland Press Herald via Getty ImagesAvangrid, the U.S. subsidiary of the Spanish utility giant Iberdrola and the owner of Central Maine Power, called the court\u2019s decision \u201ca victory for clean energy expansion, transmission development, and decarbonization efforts in Maine, New England and across the country.\u201d\u201cIt is time to move away from the status quo fossil fuel companies who will undoubtedly continue their fight to maintain a stranglehold on the New England energy market,\u201d Avangrid said in a statement.Advertisement\n\nColin Durrant, a spokesperson for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, one of the project\u2019s primary opponents, called Tuesday\u2019s court ruling \u201cdifficult to interpret,\u201d and said it is not clear when the lower court would take up its review or how long it might take.Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, the government-owned utility in Canada\u2019s French-speaking province that would sell power on the line, said it was reviewing the ruling. \u201cIt is a favorable decision,\u201d said Lynn St-Laurent, a Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec spokesperson, referring to the decision\u2019s closing arguments as \u201cquite encouraging language.\u201d It is the latest twist in a drawn-out regional saga that mirrors the greater U.S. struggle to transition its power grid off fossil fuels. The project dates back to 2016, when Massachusetts enacted a new climate law and required its power sellers to dramatically increase their supply of low-carbon energy. Working with local utilities, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec put forward a winning bid to sell more of its hydroelectric bounty to Bay Staters.Advertisement\n\nThe proposed corridor would connect New England\u2019s power grid, which is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, to the system in Qu\u00e9bec, where massive hydroelectric dams provide 24/7 low-carbon power. As states like Maine and Massachusetts rely more on solar and wind, their grid operators need more \u201cdispatchable\u201d backup generators for when the sky is dark and the air is still. Until batteries or clean hydrogen fuel become cheaper and more widely available, the best options to keep the lights on are either building more local gas-fired power plants or connecting to a grid that\u2019s bigger, sturdier and, ideally, cleaner.That\u2019s what Qu\u00e9bec has. Look at the website Electricity Maps, which uses real-time, color-coded grid data to show the carbon intensity of various regional electrical systems. The Canadian province, with a 100% renewable grid, is consistently dark green. That the brown hue of New England, with just 35% low-carbon power, has a yellowish tint at all may be because, on Tuesday afternoon, Qu\u00e9bec was exporting about 2 gigawatts of electricity over the border via existing lines.But the new project would require clearing a new 53-mile corridor through Maine\u2019s North Woods, as well as widening another 90-mile section of existing power lines. If the voters\u2019 general disdain for their utility company wasn\u2019t enough to swing the election, there is also the fact that, though the states\u2019 grid is connected, the primary users of this Canadian electricity would be residents of Massachusetts, from which Maine split in 1820. At a 2018 rally in Augusta, Maine, Kimberly Lyman, a whitewater rafting guide, speaks out against CMP's New England Clean Energy Connect, a 145-mile transmission line through Maine to bring electricity to Massachusetts residents.Portland Press Herald via Getty ImagesThere are also concerns about bisecting one of the nation\u2019s few remaining contiguous temperate forests, as well as concern about Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s dark history of stealing land from First Nation communities for hydroelectric projects that devastated local ecosystems. And while environmental groups like the Natural Resource Council of Maine and Appalachian Mountain Club made those arguments in earnest, fossil fuel companies \u2015 notably out-of-state owners of gas-fired power plants \u2015 spent millions working to drum up opposition to the project.Advertisement\n\nThe project\u2019s crushing defeat in last year\u2019s referendum highlights how high the hurdles are for long-term energy projects, even in a state where two-thirds of adults expect climate change to inflict harm in the next 10 years.U.S. property laws and the patchwork of jurisdictions offer not-in-my-backyard opponents ample opportunities to bog down an infrastructure project in legal proceedings. While natural gas pipelines enjoy special federal rights that make them easier to build, major transmission lines have proven nearly impossible to complete. Journalist Russell Gold\u2019s 2019 book \u201cSuperpower: One Man\u2019s Quest to Transform American Energy\u201d offers one poignant account of how local opponents and fossil fuel allies in Congress tanked a well-financed effort to construct a transmission line connecting wind turbines in gusty Oklahoma to cities in the Southeast.One needn\u2019t look far for more examples. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec offered Massachusetts buyers three potential routes for a transmission line, and Maine was the second choice. The first one picked in 2017 was via New Hampshire, where the company and its Boston-based partner Eversource Energy proposed building the Northern Pass line. In 2018, however, New Hampshire\u2019s utility commissioners voted unanimously to block the project, which they said would damage tourism and mostly benefit Massachusetts. The Mystic Generating Station, located just outside Boston, burns natural gas and petroleum, which contribute to climate change and produce local air pollution that neighboring communities blamed in 2020 for making COVID-19 worse.Boston Globe via Getty ImagesAdvertisement\n\nSimilar regional rivalries nearly tanked a proposal to convey hydroelectricity from Qu\u00e9bec to New York City, which became roughly 90% dependent on fossil fuels after shuttering its lone nuclear power plant last year. When that transmission project \u2015 which was first proposed 13 years ago \u2015 came before state regulators in April, officials from the state\u2019s northern reaches expressed concern that upstaters would not reap any benefits. But enough skeptics were persuaded that New York City\u2019s landmark climate law would provide sufficient financing to avoid any serious rate hikes upstate. The project passed in a 5-2 vote.The New York announcement was part of an unusual string of wins for proponents of building transmission lines. Just two weeks after the Maine vote last November, President Joe Biden signed his bipartisan infrastructure deal into law, earmarking between $5 billion and $10 billion for transmission lines. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, meanwhile, began work on a rule to require more regional transmission planning and make it easier to build lines. In June, the ailing Midcontinent Independent System Operator, the regional grid system that covers 15 states up the Mississippi River from Louisiana to Michigan, announced a $10 billion plan to build 18 new transmission lines. The MISO includes representatives from its member states\u2019 governments, which means the proposals are more likely to get permitted, according to Rob Gramlich, a power grid expert and president of the consultancy Grid Strategies LLC.Advertisement\n\nBut Biden\u2019s latest legislative win, the Inflation Reduction Act, scrapped a federal tax credit that would have helped finance construction of new power lines with the same type of write-off that developers of solar farms and wind parks claim. And even the funding in the bipartisan law falls far short of what\u2019s needed to transform an electrical industry that makes roughly $150 billion in investments each year, Gramlich said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk in Washington about transmission, and I certainly appreciate all that attention,\u201d Gramlich said. \u201cBut, to be honest, looking at the scorecard of whether we\u2019ve really moved the needle on transmission in this country?

    "maintext": "Jackson, Mississippi, lacks reliable drinking water for the indefinite future after pumps at the water treatment facility failed \u2015 a problem the city\u2019s mayor attributed to recent flooding.\u201cUntil it is fixed, it means we do not have reliable running water at scale,\u201d Gov. Tate Reeves (R) said at a Monday press conference, per the Mississippi Free Press. \u201cIt means the city cannot produce enough water to fight fires, to reliably flush toilets, and to meet other critical needs.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nHe said the state plans to call in the National Guard to help distribute bottled water, adding that water would need to be provided \u201cfor up to 180,000 people for an unknown period of time.\u201dJackson has a population of around 150,000, and about 30,000 people in surrounding communities also rely on the same water system.The state Health Department urged residents to boil any water they have for at least three minutes before drinking it or using it to cook or brush their teeth, Mississippi Today reported.The state capital had already been on a boil notice for about a month. That guidance went out around the same time that the main pumps at the O.B. Curtis water treatment facility were \u201cdamaged severely\u201d and the facility had to resort to using smaller backup pumps, according to Mississippi Today.Advertisement\n\nThose backup pumps failed this week, Reuters reported. Many homes and businesses have no running water at all, and when people do have water, it may be completely untreated.\u201cDo not drink the water,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cIn too many cases, it is raw water from the reservoir being pushed through the pipes.\u201dJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba (D) attributed Monday\u2019s pump failure to \u201ccomplications from the Pearl River flooding.\u201d Record rainfall caused the river to crest Monday, flooding streets and swelling the water levels in the reservoir that supplies the area\u2019s water.Hinds County Emergency Management Operations deputy director Tracy Funches, right, and operations coordinator Luke Chennault, wade through flood waters in northeast Jackson, Mississippi, on Monday.Rogelio V.

He was 32.Bell was found dead in Tucson, Arizona, on Monday, near where he was reported missing on Aug. 20, the Tucson Police Department told the New York Post. Authorities have not yet confirmed his cause of death.Bell\u2019s friend Matt Kinman, also a country singer, confirmed the news to music website Saving Country Music. Advertisement\n\nBorn in Kentucky, and raised in Wyoming, Bell got his start playing in a band in a local bar, according to the site\u2019s obituary.\u201cHe was one of the most authentic and magnetizing artists to grace the country music art form in the modern era,\u201d it read.\u201cAnd those who knew Luke Bell, they know this assessment is in no way hyperbole or flattery. Even though he released only one album, in that single volume, Luke Bell captured a bygone era, aura and mood in country music that escapes even the most adept and gifted of country music artists today.\u201d\u201cAs troubled as he was talented, Luke Bell nonetheless left his mark. And through the gift of his music, Luke Bell leaves the Earth and more pleasant place than he found it,\u201d the obituary continues.Advertisement\n\nMany of his country music contemporaries shared tributes after the news broke.\u201cMan\u2026Luke Bell\u2026what the fuck. RIP to a real one. Been a long time since I saw him, and I was just talking about him the other day wondering what he\u2019s been up to. Truly a sad night for country music,\u201d wrote Joshua Hedley.Mike and the Moonpies, a band, posted an emotional tribute on Facebook.\u201cI can vividly remember the first time I met Luke at Hole in the Wall over a decade ago, down to the clothes on his back. The man (and his music) left an impression,\u201d the post read. \u201cHe was a real deal traveling troubadour out there on that lost highway.

    "maintext": "Donald Trump\u2019s alternative social media platform, Truth Social, has still not been approved by Google to appear in its Play store for Android users to download, Google confirmed to HuffPost on Tuesday.Google said in a statement that the problem with the former president\u2019s app lies in its inability to properly moderate violent content posted by users. It also said that it notified Trump Media & Technology Group of the issue in mid-August, despite CEO Devin Nunes saying last week, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s taking so long.\u201d Advertisement\n\nTrump launched the Twitter lookalike in May after being kicked off the actual Twitter platform in the aftermath of the deadly Capitol attack in January 2021. Instead of \u201ctweeting,\u201d users post \u201ctruths,\u201d and instead of \u201cretweeting,\u201d they \u201cre-truth.\u201d Users appear to be \u201ctruthing\u201d and \u201cre-truthing\u201d physical threats and calls for violence against Google\u2019s policy.A Truth Social app is available for iPhone users, but others have had to rely on their web browser to access the site. Google announced last year that it had surpassed 3 billion active Android users, meaning that not having Truth Social available on the Play store could have a significant negative impact on the company\u2019s bottom line. There are, however, other ways in which Trump could make the app available to Android users, such as by having them download it off the Truth Social website. \u201cOn Aug. 19,\u201d a Google spokesperson said, \u201cwe notified Truth Social of several violations of standard policies in their current app submission and reiterated that having effective systems for moderating user-generated content is a condition of our terms of service for any app to go live on Google Play.\u201d Axios was first to report on the company\u2019s statement. Advertisement\n\nThe spokesperson continued: \u201cLast week Truth Social wrote back acknowledging our feedback and saying that they are working on addressing these issues.\u201dSo far, the app is only available to preorder on Google Play store. Nunes told the right-wing network Real America\u2019s Voice that although Truth Social was created to circumvent Big Tech, it is still somewhat beholden to tech giants Apple and Google, because they control which apps are available from their respective app stores.But availability isn\u2019t the only problem facing Trump\u2019s platform.Citing documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, The Washington Post reported over the weekend that Truth Social\u2019s business plan is on thin ice, with no guaranteed revenue stream and mediocre traffic. The site\u2019s financial woes could worsen further if Trump \u201cbecomes less popular or there are further controversies that damage his credibility,\u201d one filing states.The former president is currently facing legal threats on multiple fronts, most notably in recent weeks for improperly storing top-secret government documents in a basement room at his Mar-a-Lago golf club \u2015 potentially in violation of federal law. On Tuesday morning, he went on a rampage via Truth Social, \u201cre-truthing\u201d around 60 posts, according to a count by Rolling Stone. Most attacked President Joe Biden, and one went so far as to claim \u2015 yet again \u2015 that Trump had actually won the 2020 election and should be reinstated to the Oval Office.Advertisement\n\nHuffPost\u2019s requests for comment from Truth Social was not immediately returned.Related...Biden Calls Out GOP Members Warning Of 'Blood In The Street' If Trump Is ProsecutedAs Biden Goes On Offense, Trump Goes UnhingedStocks Dive For Truth Social SPAC Amid Merger Delay",

    "maintext": "Secret Service Assistant Director Tony Ornato, who was at the center of bombshell testimony about former President Donald Trump\u2019s alleged outbursts during the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, has stepped down from the federal agency.Ornato, who at one point also served as a White House political adviser to Trump, retired Monday \u201cin good standing after 25 years of devoted service,\u201d Kevin Helgert, a special agent at the Secret Service, confirmed in a statement to HuffPost.Advertisement\n\nIn a message to CNN, Ornato said he is leaving the agency to pursue a career in the private sector.\u201cI long-planned to retire and have been planning this transition for more than a year,\u201d he told the network.Tony Ornato, who at one point served as a political adviser to then-President Donald Trump, retired from his role as an assistant director at the Secret Service on Monday.fleta.govHe did not provide any details about his next move but did say that he is not taking up a role with Trump or any of Trump\u2019s businesses.Ornato\u2019s departure follows Cassidy Hutchinson testifying in June that he personally told the former White House aide about witnessing Trump lunge at a Secret Service agent who refused the president\u2019s request to drive him to the Capitol during the 2021 insurrection.Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe president said something to the effect of, I\u2019m the f-ing president, take me up to the Capitol now. To which [Secret Service agent Bobby Engel] responded, \u2018Sir, we have to go back to the West Wing,\u2019\u201d Hutchinson recalled Ornato telling her at the time. \u201cThe president reached up toward the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel. Mr. Engel grabbed his arm and said, \u2018Sir, you need to take your hand off the steering wheel, we\u2019re going back to the West Wing. We\u2019re not going to the Capitol,\u2019\u201d Hutchinson continued. \u201cMr. Trump then used his free hand to lunge towards Bobby Engel and when Ornato had recounted the story to me, he had motioned towards his clavicles.\u201d Hutchinson\u2019s testimony came amid a yearslong investigation by a House select committee into the attack on the Capitol and efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Ornato, a longtime Secret Service agent, took a break from his work with the law enforcement body in 2019 to serve as deputy chief of staff for operations at the White House. In this role, which he held for approximately a year, he helped organize Trump\u2019s political rallies and an infamous photo-op in which the then-president held a Bible outside the White House. This switch from serving as a protective agent to politics was unprecedented at the time. His eventual return to the Secret Service in late 2020 to oversee training would raise questions about agents\u2019 ability to loyally protect then-incoming President Joe Biden due to any political alignments with Trump.

    "maintext": "Under a new law, Texas public schools must display posters that say \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d if they are donated to a campus. But when a parent offered signs written in Arabic and rainbow colors, they were rejected. Texas passed a law last year that requires public schools to display the national motto if the signs are received as donations or purchased with donated money.Advertisement\n\nThe Carroll Independent School District, an affluent, largely white district, last month received a shipment of signs with the motto emblazoned on a blue background above the U.S. flag, according to the Dallas Morning News. They were reportedly donated by Patriot Mobile, a Christian conservative wireless provider that helped to elect conservatives to school board seats in the area.The Southlake Anti-Racism Coalition, a group of current and former Carroll ISD students \u201cdemanding systemic, anti-racist change\u201d in the district, however, is pushing back against the law \u2015 and testing out its boundaries.Sravan Krishna, a parent in Southlake who worked with the coalition, attempted to donate the signs in Arabic and with rainbow designs at a board meeting on Monday. \u201cWe will have to look at what remedies we have so we don\u2019t get excluded from our public schools,\u201d Krishna said. \u201cWe deserve to be included in these efforts as well.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nBoard president Cameron Bryan declined the posters, saying that the district had already accepted enough signs to display the motto at all of Carroll\u2019s campuses.The law does not mention a limit on donated signs. It says the sign must be framed or on durable poster board and must include an American flag \u2015 conditions which Krishna\u2019s signs met.\u201cBy putting signs around the school with religious messaging, they are forcing religion onto what should be a secular environment,\u201d the anti-racism group said in a social media post. \u201cThe school is also making several students uncomfortable with what the words imply. We should all have a say on what gets hung up at our school, and we shouldn\u2019t have to sit by idly and watch how these new rules are making fellow students feel like they don\u2019t belong.\u201dCarroll ISD has been a hotbed for controversy in recent years. The U.S. Department of Education opened a civil rights probe into it last year to investigate complaints about discrimination against students based on their race, gender and national origin.Southlake is also at the center of a political firestorm over school curriculum and books on race, gender and sexuality that some conservatives have falsely conflated with critical race theory.Advertisement\n\nRelated...Doug Mastriano Says Discouraging 'Conversion Therapy' Is 'Disgusting'Michigan Town Defunds Library So Kids Can't Read LBGTQ BooksDistrict That Named School After Black Author Rules Parts Of His Memoir 'Not Appropriate'",

    "maintext": "Michael Jennings handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser in May.Screenshot AL.com via YouTubeMichael Jennings was dutifully watering his out-of-town neighbors\u2019 flowers \u2014 upon their request \u2014 when he was approached by police. Bodycam footage released this week by Jennings\u2019 attorneys show that within minutes, he was arrested, handcuffed and placed in the back of a cruiser.\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be here. I\u2019m Pastor Jennings. I live across the street,\u201d Jennings told an officer during the May 22 exchange in his neighbors\u2019 driveway in Childersburg, Alabama. Advertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking out for their house while they\u2019re gone, watering their flowers,\u201d he added.Jennings told ABC News that he is now considering filing a racial discrimination lawsuit against the Childersburg Police Department.HuffPost reached out to the Childersburg Police Department for comment and was hung up on.The 20-minute video posted to YouTube by AL.com (above) captured his subsequent arrest. During the initial confrontation, police tell Jennings they are responding to a call about a vehicle and a person that\u2019s \u201cnot supposed to be here.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s saying that?\u201d Jennings asks the officer.\u201cThey called about it. ... I don\u2019t know,\u201d the officer says to Jennings.Jennings then seems to shrug the call off, and continues to water the flowers, but tells officers his name and explains to police he\u2019s looking out for his neighbors\u2019 home while they\u2019re gone.Advertisement\n\nPolice then ask Jennings \u2014 who says in the video he used to be an officer himself \u2014 for identification. Jennings refuses, telling the officer that he\u2019s not doing anything wrong.The officer then repeatedly refers to Jennings as \u201csuspicious person\u201d \u2014 which seems to irritate Jennings, who says he\u2019s not doing anything suspicious.\u201cYou want to lock me up, lock me up. I\u2019m not showing y\u2019all anything,\u201d Jennings says. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue watering these flowers. I don\u2019t care who called y\u2019all. Lock me up and see what happens.\u201dJennings is soon handcuffed. As he sits on his neighbors\u2019 porch, he tells officers his son was just racially profiled. Right afterward, an officer begins to yell at Jennings and an agitated Jennings yells back. He is eventually escorted to the back of a police cruiser.Following Jennings\u2019 arrest, police locate the neighbor who says she called them. Upon seeing Jennings, she tells authorities that she recognizes him.Advertisement\n\n\u201cHe lives right there, and he would be watering their flowers. This is probably my fault,\u201d the woman tells police, explaining that Jennings is friends with the homeowners.But despite the woman telling officers she knows Jennings, he was still arrested and charged \u2014 although the charges were later dismissed in June by a municipal judge, NPR reported.\u201cThis video makes it clear that these officers decided they were going to arrest Pastor Jennings less than five minutes after pulling up and then tried to rewrite history claiming he hadn\u2019t identified himself when that was the first thing he did,\u201d Harry Daniels, an Atlanta-based attorney representing Jennings, told NPR in a statement.\u201cIt\u2019s irrational, irresponsible and illegal,\u201d he added.Alabama law states that any officer \u201cmay stop any person abroad in a public place\u201d if they suspect that the person is committing or has committed a felony or another public offense. They could then demand the person\u2019s name, address and explanation of actions. Jennings\u2019 lawyers argue in their statement to NPR that he did not have to provide identification to law enforcement because \u201che was not in a public place.\u201dJennings explained to ABC News that he was \u201cagitated\u201d during the incident. But he said he was also confused and fearful that resisting arrest would be life-threatening.Advertisement\n\n\u201cI was trying to cooperate even though I didn\u2019t understand what was going on,\u201d he told ABC News. \u201cI was angry, but I knew to comply.\u201dHe also said that the experience was traumatizing. He noted to ABC that he has a collection of Black history memorabilia, which include a pair of antique handcuffs from the 1800s. He said he thought of them when he was being handcuffed by police.\u201cThis thing came to my mind, that to be shackled and to have your freedom taken away from you, it\u2019s something else. It\u2019s dehumanizing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that gives you nightmares.\u201dRelated...Why Police Body Cameras Are Not A Cure-AllFired Vermont Cop Shown Kicking Handcuffed Man On Video Is Still On The Ballot For SheriffFlorida Cop Blocks Pregnant Woman In Pain From Entering Hospital Just Feet AwayArizona Sued Over Controversial Law Limiting How People Film Police Officers",

    "maintext": "NASA rescheduled the launch of its Artemis I mission around the moon to Saturday after the space agency was forced to scrub the first attempt due to an issue with one of the spacecraft\u2019s engines.The main problem Monday came after engineers couldn\u2019t get one of the rocket\u2019s four engines to the proper temperature needed to start them at liftoff. NASA said the Artemis team tried to quickly fix the issue before the scheduled departure time, but weren\u2019t able to do so before a two-hour launch window closed.Advertisement\n\nMike Sarafin, the Artemis mission manager, said the team had found a path forward, including changing the engines\u2019 loading procedure and starting the engine chill down earlier. The mission is the first in a series of launches that could ultimately see astronauts headed toward the moon for the first time in half a century and a major revitalization of NASA\u2019s space exploration efforts.The next launch window opens at 2:17 p.m. ET Saturday for two hours, weather permitting. An additional window would open on Monday, NASA said.If the mission isn\u2019t able to launch, it could potentially be pushed back by more than a month.Teams have reviewed the data from Monday's launch attempt of the #Artemis I mission and are moving forward with a second launch attempt on Sat., Sept. 3, with a two-hour launch window starting at 2:17 p.m. EDT (18:17 UTC). pic.twitter.com/oDr5plGhqS\u2014 NASA Artemis (@NASAArtemis) August 30, 2022\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision Monday was a disappointment for thousands of rocket-watchers who drove to Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, including Vice President Kamala Harris. But NASA said it wouldn\u2019t fire up the rocket until doing so was safe, despite years of delays that have beleaguered the $40 billion project. While we hoped to see the launch of Artemis I today, the attempt provided valuable data as we test the most powerful rocket in history. Our commitment to the Artemis Program remains firm, and we will return to the moon.\u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) August 29, 2022\n\n#Artemis1 was delayed due to an engine bleed issue, but testing is part of the process. #Artemis2 will carry @NASA_Astronauts, so we need to ensure we get it right.

Advertisement\n\nThe Artemis mission will test NASA\u2019s Space Launch System, a powerful rocket, that will propel the Orion spacecraft beyond the moon. The mission will be unmanned (holding three humanoid dummies), but the Orion craft will eventually be able to hold astronauts and begin a new era of space exploration. Humans haven\u2019t stepped foot on the moon since the last Apollo mission in 1972, and NASA has pledged future efforts would see the first woman and the first person of color step foot on the lunar surface.When it does eventually leave, Artemis I will orbit the Earth before being propelled towards the moon. The spacecraft will fly within 60 miles of the moon\u2019s surface as NASA monitors its systems, then go on into deep retrograde orbit for just under a week.The full mission will last four to six weeks before the Orion spacecraft reenters the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, traveling some 25,000 mph and producing temperatures approaching 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\u201cAfter about four to six weeks and a total distance traveled exceeding 1.3 million miles, the mission will end with a test of Orion\u2019s capability to return safely to the Earth,\u201d NASA says of the mission.The Artemis I launch, if it moves forward, will cap an invigorating summer for the country\u2019s space agency. The heralded James Webb Space Telescope has been transmitting magical images from deep space since July, stunning cosmologists and astronomers and ushering in a new era of stargazing.Advertisement\n\nSafety is always first. Following today's #Artemis I launch attempt, @NASAArtemis teams are working through an issue with engine number 3, and expect to give a news briefing later today.

    "maintext": "Venture capitalist Blake Masters, who won the Republican nomination for Arizona\u2019s U.S. Senate race with Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement, has since removed language from his website that supported the former president\u2019s lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.According to CNN\u2019s KFile, Masters has modified wording on his site that supported Trump\u2019s election claims, argued the country would be better off if Trump was still president, and claimed Democrats are trying to \u201cimport\u201d a new electorate \u2015 rhetoric that matches a white supremacist conspiracy theory. Advertisement\n\nThose views were on Masters\u2019 website on Aug. 1, the day before he clinched the GOP primary. They\u2019ve since disappeared.One section that was edited initially read: \u201cWe need to get serious about election integrity. The 2020 election was a rotten mess \u2015 if we had had a free and fair election, President Trump would be sitting in the Oval Office today and America would be so much better off.\u201dNow, it says: \u201cWe need to get serious about election integrity.\u201dMasters, who is bankrolled by tech billionaire Peter Thiel, struggled to gain momentum in the earlier leg of his campaign but picked up speed after receiving Trump\u2019s endorsement.

    "maintext": "Getty ImagesAmericans love their hot dogs, eating about 7 billion from Memorial Day to Labor Day, according to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council. And Hulu\u2019s hit show \u201cThe Bear\u201d has not only sparked a great thirst for handsome line cooks, but it has also reignited a great debate over which condiments are acceptable on a hot dog.Take, for instance, the following conversation from Episode 4: Richie: \u201cWhat kind of a**hole puts ketchup on a hot dog?\u201dCarmy: \u201cA child, Richie.\u201d It turns out Carmy isn\u2019t the only Chicagoan who thinks that way.The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council has identified 18 regional-style hot dogs across the United States, but there are likely way more. In New York, hot dogs are eaten with mustard and steamed onions. From Arizona through California, the Sonora hot dog is wrapped in bacon and topped with pinto beans, jalape\u00f1os, spicy grilled peppers and crema. Advertisement\n\nBut in Chicago, where \u201cThe Bear\u201d is based and hot dogs are legendary, the idea of putting ketchup on a hot dog can be controversial.The classic Chicago hot dog has mustard, neon-green relish, raw onions, a full pickle spear, tomatoes, a little bit of celery salt and a poppy seed bun; sport peppers are optional. Historians link the Chicago version to the Depression, when people could get a full meal from a hot dog and toppings.Maren Caruso via Getty ImagesA Chicago dog, in all its glory, and free from ketchup.But don\u2019t even consider putting ketchup on it, at least according to certain Chicagoans. Even President Barack Obama, a Chicago native, said several years ago on CNN that \u201cit\u2019s not acceptable past the age of 8.\u201d Advertisement\n\nSome Chicagoland hot dog stands pride themselves on not serving ketchup, such as Gene and Jude\u2019s in River Grove, just outside the city.Other Chicagoans take a more live and let live approach. Bill Savage, a professor at Northwestern University and a Chicago historian, said the whole argument is about identity and authenticity. \u201cIf you like ketchup on your hot dogs, and you put it on there, who really cares?\u201d Savage asked. \u201cNobody, except some judgmental person who says, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re not really authentic.\u2019\u201dBut there may be some practical reasons why ketchup may not be an ideal condiment, from a flavor profile perspective.\u201cGenerally the reasoning behind it is just the sweetness of the ketchup,\u201d said Eric Mittenthal, the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council president. \u201cIt\u2019s just not an ideal complement to the hot dog.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nDoug Sohn, the founder of Hot Doug\u2019s Inc. who is known for pushing the limits of encased meats with toppings of foie gras and other unique ingredients, doesn\u2019t love ketchup as a condiment in general.\u201cI think the flavor elements of ketchup, both in its sweetness and acidity as well as the cinnamon, cloves, etc., that are in it, clash with the other hot dog condiments,\u201d he said. Other experts believe ketchup confuses and overpowers other condiments, and not just the ones on a Chicago-style hot dog, said Manolis Alpogianis, owner of America\u2019s Dog & Burger, known for serving eight different kinds of regional hot dogs. Mustard is a different story, observed Bob Schwartz, a Vienna Beef hot dog executive and author of \u201dNever Put Ketchup On A Hot Dog.\u201d It \u201cblends more with the hot dog,\u201d he said.Ketchup is kid\u2019s stuffChildren tend to be given a pass. Of course, the cutoff age is a controversy as well. Obama said 8. The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council says 18.Advertisement\n\nncognet0 via Getty ImagesCarmy has a point. Kids really do love the sweetness of ketchup.But the same reason that ketchup might not work for adults may be the reason that children like it: the sweetness. Alpogianis explained that kids tend not to like more complex flavors of mustard and onions. But taste is not just a factor of age. \u201cBoth age and genetics combine with our culture to shape our love of particular foods, including ketchup,\u201d said Danielle Reed, associate director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. \u201cSome people are born with genetic variants that promote a greater liking for sweetness, which can be exacerbated by age, with young children generally preferring sweeter foods than adults.\u201d For Reed, the ketchup vs. mustard debate is really about the war between sweet and savory.  \u201cSome people strongly object to what they view as the over-sweetness of many prepared foods while others love sweetness,\u201d she said. There\u2019s shame in the ketchup gameChicago may not be the only place to eschew ketchup. In the roster of regional-style hot dogs, none list ketchup as an ingredient. Advertisement\n\nBut Schwartz and Alpogianis both agree that it\u2019s really in Chicago where this debate rages on. Some places in the U.S. use ketchup as a matter of course, others just don\u2019t. Culinary conflict is part of it, but it\u2019s also cultural, explained Schwartz. In some places, it\u2019s just tradition not to put ketchup on a hot dog. Of course not everyone upholds tradition. A 2021 survey of 1,000 Americans (represented in the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council graphic below) found that mustard is the most popular condiment for hot dogs, followed by a tie between ketchup and onions:At its core, the flexibility of toppings is one of the best things about the hot dog, allowing for personal creativity.\u201cThere\u2019s only two kinds of foods: good and bad,\u201d Sohn explained. \u201cAnd if it tastes good, then go ahead.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nRelated...Nutritionists Recommend A Limit For Hot Dogs, And It Might Shock YouHere\u2019s What You\u2019re Really Eating When You Get That \u2018Snap\u2019 From A Hot DogYou'll Never Want To Guess What's In Your Hot Dog",

    "maintext": "ljubaphoto via Getty ImagesHeart issues in kids can be more subtle and present differently than adults.When it comes to raising kids, there\u2019s a lot to keep track of: dentist appointments, recitals, wellness visits, soccer practice \u2015 the list goes on and is never organized in your brain of what\u2019s most important first. And then there are the things that are on the list whether you\u2019re aware of them or not \u2015 like your child\u2019s heart health. You know that you want, and maybe even assume, that your child\u2019s heart is tiptop shape, but how do you know if it\u2019s not?Advertisement\n\n Thankfully, you don\u2019t have to do this alone, explained Dr. Sharon E. O\u2019Brien, director of pediatric cardiology at Boston University School of Medicine. \u201cOne of the reasons pregnant women have a fetal screen ultrasound is to detect congenital heart disease,\u201d she said. Depending on the type of ultrasound and sensitivity of the test, these screenings can detect anywhere from 65% to 95% of congenital heart disease.But not all heart disease starts in utero. O\u2019Brien said these are known as acquired heart issues, and don\u2019t develop until early childhood or beyond. Here are some of the red flags that your child may be dealing with heart issues. Plus, some advice on what you can do to help keep your kid\u2019s heart healthy, so they don\u2019t have a problem down the road during adulthood.Excessive sweating and poor weight gainIf you find your child sweating profusely regardless of the weather, that could be a warning sign for a heart issue. It\u2019s especially important to pay attention to newborns doing this, said Dr. Achiau Ludormirsky, a pediatric cardiologist at Hassenfeld Children\u2019s Hospital at NYU Langone. \u201cIf there is excessive sweating, where you have to change their clothes every two to three hours, that\u2019s something to be concerned about,\u201d he said. Advertisement\n\nLudormirsky added that slow weight gain because of poor feeding may also signal a problem, particularly if they fall asleep on the breast or bottle shortly after they start eating, preventing them from getting the calories they need. \u201cYou may also notice the baby huffing and puffing for a long time after eating, which is clinically referred to as tachypnea \u2015 a high respiratory rate,\u201d he said. All these symptoms, along with a rapid heart rate (known as tachycardia) may mean your child has intracardiac shunting \u2015 abnormal pathways for blood flow that put the heart in volume and pressure overload. \u201cWhile your newborn will be monitored after birth, if you get home and notice they have blue lips or extremities, this can be cyanotic heart disease which results in low blood oxygen level and should be mentioned to a pediatrician,\u201d Ludormirsky added. Chest pain (and other funny feelings)The same complaint that fires off warning bells for adults when it comes to their heart can also be worrisome when children start to complain about it, too. Just keep in mind, however, that kids may express this pain differently than adults.Advertisement\n\n \u201cFor younger kids, it can be hard to distinguish what\u2019s going on,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cIt\u2019s normal for heart rates to change based on what we\u2019re doing, such as sleeping versus running, but sometimes heartbeats can be abnormally fast when they don\u2019t need to be.\u201d Be mindful of chest \u201cpain\u201d that could be actual pain or palpitations, along with other symptoms like exercise intolerance, not being able to keep up with their friends, and being tired all the time (i.e., a child that always must be carried through the grocery store when peers their age walk without difficulty). \u201cIf your child has experienced fainting, that\u2019s a big red flag that needs immediate evaluation,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.In addition to chest pain, notice if any corresponding symptoms come up in young kids, such as fever or rash. \u201cThis could be Kawasaki disease, which can cause inflammation in the coronary arteries and requires treatment,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.Family historySometimes the sign that heart issues may be a problem for your child can be found on paper through their family history. Advertisement\n\n\u201cIn some cases, there is a family gene of hypercholesterolemia,\u201d Ludormirsky said. \u201cThis is high cholesterol of 600 or more. In these cases, it\u2019s always best to get the child set up with a cardiologist to help prevent early coronary heart disease.\u201d If you\u2019ve had a family member have a heart attack at an early age, require a pacemaker, or any other cardiac issues, O\u2019Brien said it\u2019s best to mention that to your pediatrician so they are aware and can assess accordingly. Biz Jones via Getty ImagesKeeping kids active is one way to promote a healthy heart.How to prevent heart disease in kidsWhen specialists discuss and evaluate heart disease in kids, there are two main buckets: congenital issues and acquired. But there is a third group \u2015 preventative, said Dr. Carissa Baker-Smith, director of the pediatric preventive cardiology program at Nemours Children\u2019s Health in Wilmington, Delaware, and an American Heart Association volunteer expert. \u201cWhen we talk about heart disease and adulthood \u2015 things like high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke \u2015 we often assume they only happen as adults. Yet these conditions can begin in early childhood if we\u2019re not taking the proper preventative measures,\u201d she said. Advertisement\n\nHere are a few ways Baker-Smith said you can protect your child\u2019s heart health and spot warning signs early on: Recognize when a child\u2019s weight for their height is not normal. Stay on top of your child\u2019s wellness visits, as your pediatrician will log their growth chart. A body mass index greater than 85% is considered overweight and 95% is clinically classified as obesity. Joyful movement is important. Even when the weather gods are against you \u2015 get your kids moving around the house. Anything goes \u2015 a game of Twister, helping you clean, making silly TikTok videos, whatever has them off the couch and moving. Meal balance is key. Try to get as many fruits and vegetables into their diet as possible. When fresh isn\u2019t an option, frozen is a healthy substitute. (Skip canned fruits and veggies though, as they contain a lot of salt and sugar.) Practice portion control. An easy way to do this is to serve kids meals on a salad plate. They don\u2019t need to be (and shouldn\u2019t be) eating the same amount of food adults are yet.

But, when you deal with teeth grinding, that probably isn\u2019t the case. You end up with pain, tooth issues, and you may even wake up a little tired.Plus, when you deal with teeth grinding \u2015 or bruxism, as it\u2019s known medically \u2015 you will likely deal with repercussions that go way beyond the anticipated tooth pain and damage. Advertisement\n\n\u201cYour dental health can affect your medical health,\u201d said Dr. Floretta Cuffey-Terry, president of Robert T. Freeman Dental Society in Washington, D.C. If you are a chronic tooth grinder, you may experience adjacent issues that range from nutrition problems to an onslaught of stress.Here, experts share the signs you should look out for if you think you may be grinding your teeth at night, along with some advice on how to address it.HeadachesIf you spend your sleeping hours grinding your teeth, it\u2019s highly likely that you\u2019ll end up with headaches as a result of that pressure in your mouth and jaw, said Dr. Albert Coombs, owner of Smile Services DC and member of the international dental implant association.These morning headaches are basically your body\u2019s way of coming down from an extreme amount of pressure overnight, he added. Tooth-grinding headaches generally occur around the temples and back toward the ears.Advertisement\n\nJaw painSimilarly to waking up with a headache, you may wake up with pain around your mouth muscles or notice fatigue in your jaw muscles, Cuffey-Terry said. This pain can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, but will likely be at its worst when you wake up in the morning.Jaw pain is not something you should be waking up with automatically, so if you notice this sensation, get in touch with your dentist.Tooth painIt may seem obvious, but if you have tooth pain or tooth soreness in the morning, you may be dealing with bruxism.Dr. Marjan Moghadam, a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s College of Dentistry, noted that toothaches are a clear sign of teeth grinding at night. And, they\u2019re reason enough to call your dentist. (And even beyond morning tooth pain, toothaches at any time of day should be reported.)Wear and tear on your teethAccording to Moghadam, \u201cthe act of grinding can cause tooth wear that over time can lead to destruction of the tooth structure itself, as well as the bone that supports the tooth in the jawbone.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nSpecifically, if you\u2019re looking in your mouth and notice that your tooth crown (which is the visible part of the tooth) is wearing down, you may be grinding your teeth at night, Cuffey-Terry added. In this instance, you may notice a chip in your tooth or discoloration in the form of white streaks.You may also notice a shift in your teeth, Moghadam added. If you have a tooth that appears to be pushed forward or backward out of nowhere, you may be grinding your teeth while you sleep.Science Photo Library via Getty ImagesHeadaches, jaw pain and toothaches are all signs of nighttime teeth grinding.Sensitivity to hot and cold foodsThat wear and tear on your teeth impacts how you eat, too. According to Coombs, it is also common to experience sensitivity to hot and cold foods and drinks if you are a chronic grinder.\u201cThis has to do with the fact that, if you\u2019re a prolonged grinder, you\u2019ll start to see small fracture lines throughout the teeth,\u201d he said. Those small fracture lines are \u201calmost direct access to the nerve of the tooth.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nIf that glass of ice cold water has a clear path to your tooth\u2019s nerve, you better believe you\u2019ll feel some sensitivity as soon as you take a sip. Daytime sleepinessSomeone who constantly grinds their teeth may not realize it, but they are likely waking themselves up every couple of hours throughout the night, Coombs said.This could be from discomfort or pain, or just the fact that a constantly moving mouth means a disruptive night of rest. As a result, you may be more likely to deal with sleepiness during the day.Teeth grinding is more common now than it was pre-pandemicYou\u2019re probably very aware that living through a pandemic has been stressful. So have things like inflation and political unrest, to name a few.And stress manifests itself in more ways than you\u2019d think, including teeth grinding.The National Institutes of Health \u201cdid research in 2020 [that discovered] the linkage between stress and bruxism,\u201d Coombs said. \u201cWhat they found is 95% of people that are under an immense amount of stress show signs of bruxism.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nAnd who isn\u2019t at least a little bit stressed right now?Coombs added that the American Dental Association found a 70% increase in bruxism in a March 2021 poll, which cited the pandemic as the reason behind the increase in this stress response. If teeth grinding was something you never dealt with before, you\u2019re not alone if you all of a sudden notice some teeth-grinding red flags.If you suspect you\u2019re grinding your teeth, see your dentistIf you think you\u2019re grinding your teeth at night, you should seek professional help from your dentist, Moghadam said.\u201cThe dentist can examine and evaluate the signs and symptoms in order to rule out any other issue \u2014 such as dental infection or other habits that could be contributing.\u201dThey\u2019ll also be able to make recommendations for the best next steps and treatments, which can include mouth guards, muscle relaxers or even stress management.

    "maintext": "Sephora Saie's Sun Melt natural cream bronzer, the Fenty Beauty Sun Stalk'r bronzer and the Merit bronze balm stick.       The cosmetics industry is notorious for excluding the nuanced and diverse skin tones of its consumer base \u2014 particularly deeper and more melanated complexions. And while the limited shade ranges offered by a variety of makeup and skincare products is just one example of how Black and Brown people are being overlooked, the lack of inclusion is particularly stark in the world of bronzers. So much so that Atlanta, Georgia-based makeup artist Mi\u2019Chel Bombshell founded her own cosmetics company, Beauty By Mi\u2019Chel, in an effort to fill in the representation gaps that some mainstream brands have left wide open.  \u201cI experienced that the options for darker shades are limited with bronzers, especially when it comes to big name companies,\u201d Bombshell told HuffPost. \u201cThe big misconception is that people of color don\u2019t use bronzer, which is false. It\u2019s like saying \u2018Black people don\u2019t sun burn.\u2019\u201d She explained that bronzers aren\u2019t necessarily intended to contour the face or to change the skin tone entirely. Instead, it\u2019s meant to \u201cbring your skin back to life\u201d after you have used your setting powders and other mattifying products \u2013\u2013 something that isn\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t be, exclusive to the lighter-complected.  \u201cWhen choosing a bronzer, you should find a shade that is no more that two shades darker than your natural skin tone,\u201d Bombshell said. \u201cYou should also know your undertone. The wrong bronzer can have you looking too red or even too dark.\u201d  We still have a long way to go when it comes to better representation in the world of beauty, but Bombshell said that as people of color continue to be vocal about the ways in which they are being left out, brands are starting to listen. Currently, there are some bronzers on the market that individuals with brown skin, including Bombshell, find favorable, so we combed the reviews and rounded them up here. Ahead, see a list of rich-toned bronzers that reviewers say deliver that enviable, sunkissed glow.  HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change.       1SephoraA soft-matte cream bronzerThis bronzer by Danessa Myricks applies like a cream, melts into the skin and dries down like a powder. This finish is soft, matte and blurring and can work over existing makeup or on bare skin. Danessa Myricks is a Black-owned beauty company created by a self-taught makeup artist who aims to create beauty products for people of all ages, races and genders. Promising review: \"I really like this bronzer! I never thought I'd be someone to use a bronzer, even though I know there are a lot of bronzers that have come out for Black people more recently, but I never thought I'd be interested. I decided to give this a try, and I think technically I use it more as a contour but I really like it! And it looks really nice as a blush as well. The formula and feel of the product is really nice and a little goes a long way. It's easy to blend out and doesn't blend out to nothing. I usually don't wear foundation and it wears really nicely on bare skin, and nicely over foundation too.\" \u2013\u2013 4cbeauty $26 at Sephora2SephoraA natural-looking bronzer balm with a dewy finishThe Saie Sun Melt bronzer has a creamy texture and a natural-to-dewy finish that's not cakey or patchy. Its formulation boasts antioxidant-rich grape seed oil, calming colloidal oatmeal and balancing elderberry extract. Promising reviews: \"Really love this bronzer. It shows up on my darker skin tone and gives me a bronzed look.\" \u2013\u2013 bellemarabou\"Very skeptical of the whole bronzer situation (I\u2019m already brown\u2026 didn\u2019t see the appeal). I\u2019ve used powder bronzer before on rare occasions, often they look weird/unnatural or don\u2019t show up on my skin. BUT THIS bronzer has me reevaluating my entire life\u2026 I purchased the bronzer and the brush (if you're gonna do it.. do it right) and let me tell you.. it lives up to the hype. The color is perfect for my skin tone, it\u2019s deep enough to show but not super red-toned. Application is easy and beginner friendly. It\u2019s not super shimmery or glowy so I feel comfortable wearing it with a low key makeup look. Love!\" \u2013\u2013 apstory$30 at Sephora$30 at Saie3SephoraA sheer bronzing stick that feels like second skinSculpt, add warmth and condition skin all at once with this balmy bronzing stick from Merit. Although it goes on sheer, the formula is filled with skin-loving fatty acids and is ultra buildable for a customizable wear.Promising review: \"I\u2019m so in love with this product. It\u2019s so smooth, super lightweight and blends like a dream. I love the fact that it\u2019s also buildable. A lot of cream bronzers never really go deep enough shade wise to show up on my skin and do what is supposed to do but Merit understood the assignment with this one. 10/10 recommend.\" \u2013\u2013 byLade$30 at Sephora$30 at Merit4SephoraA long-wearing smooth powder bronzerSince its founding, Fenty Beauty has been a champion for shade inclusivity within the beauty industry. This soft-matte and transfer-resistant powder promises to be super blendable and give skin a warm glow that will last all day. Promising review: \"Worth the hype and awesome for dark skin! it was easily blendable, the color was good for me as it matched some of the reddish hyperpigmentation on my forehead & edges of my face and it felt weightless.\" \u2013\u2013 Valerieee123$34 at Sephora$34 at Ulta$34 at Fenty Beauty5SephoraA matte-finish and finely milled bronzing powderCharlotte Tilbury is known to turn out makeup products with some pretty impressive blurring and perfecting capabilities for the skin \u2014 and this finely milled and silky-feeling pressed powder is no different. It's been formulated with hyaluronic acid for an added dose of hydration and even comes in a refillable pan to make purchasing the oversized compact a one-time-thing. Promising reviews: \"This is a must have. As a black woman it\u2019s hard finding a good bronzer. This is worth every cent ladies!\" \u2013\u2013 nanny101\"Absolutely Gorgeous! After watching and reading numerous reviews on this product I\u2019m very glad that I took the dive and purchased this. It\u2019s my first CT product and I\u2019m indeed very satisfied. This color (4-Deep) enhances my facial structure and looks natural when applied lightly, or extra diva-licious if applied for a full face. This product is soft and doesn\u2019t feel as if you\u2019ve even applied anything at all.\" \u2013\u2013 Wond3rWoman $56 at Sephora$56 at Nordstrom$56 at Charlotte Tilbury6SephoraA hydrating bronzing liquid infused with skin careWeightless, easy-to-layer and highly blendable (even over your other makeup products), this gel-like liquid bronzer is a great option for dehydrated skin.

I love the quality and packaging. It\u2019s very easy to use and apply as well. I like that it goes well with brown skin and melts into my skin color naturally. It doesn\u2019t leave a shadow line unlike some of my other bronzers! It also gives a very radiant look!\" \u2013\u2013 glambymitz \"Love it! Super easy to blend and the color looks natural on my brown skin. Its better to use a brush to get the most flawless look in my opinion! Also it\u2019s very lightweight so I love it for contouring without looking caked up.\" \u2013\u2013 jessrrid$30 at Sephora$30 at Milk Makeup7UltaA pigmented powder duoThis bronzing duo by Juvia's Place, a small Black-owned beauty brand, features two matte and powders that allow you to both define and add warmth to the face. Reviewers say these pressed powders are rich, smooth and pigmented. Promising reviews: \"This bronzer duo is beautiful!! I'm a Black woman with medium tan skin with a neutral hint of yellow undertone and the Tan duo was perfect for me. Adds such gorgeous warmth to my face and applies wonderfully.\" \u2013\u2013 boomkattack \"Amazingly beautiful and pigmented. Smooth and looks so good on my dark skin.

I found out I was pregnant and needed some type of support when walking around on vacation, rather than flat flip-flops. I read the reviews for these shoes and they were raving. I see why!! These could sell for more money but are reasonably priced. Great quality. There are no laces to tie \u2014 elastic bands. I really love these with or without socks. They are roomy but not too big width-wise. This is not a very narrow shoe. I would recommend this shoe for anyone traveling as the go-to shoe. They\u2019re easy to get on and get off.

If your pots and pans are in disorganized heap inside your cabinet and your shelves are filled with toppling towers of food storage containers that you can never find matching lids for, then this one is for you. Pinterest-worthy spice racks, neatly arranged cutlery drawers and roomy countertop spaces that you can actually use are all achievable with the following list of products that have \u201corganized\u201d written all over them.

Prices and availability are subject to change.1www.amazon.comA bestselling cutlery organizerPromising review: \"Yes, this little utensil tray is really that good! I went from using 12 inches of horizontal space in a lovely but huge wooden utensil tray to about using about four inches (whatever the width of this godsend is). It stores my butter knives, steak knives, spoons, forks, and a slew of little teaspoons. I'd guess that the max capacity for each slot is about 10 pieces. For example, I fit four butter knives and four steak knives into the first/knife slot easily, with good wiggle room. This is such a great design. Using this tray opened up about half of my 18-inch wide drawer, which allowed me to decompress the other drawers in my kitchen a bit. I highly recommend this item. It's worth every penny.\" \u2014 Kathleen Cooke$10 at Amazon2www.amazon.comAn organizer to sort and keep track of Tupperware lidsYouCopia is a woman-owned small biz that makes ingenious home and kitchen storage solutions. The organizer has five adjustable dividers so you can sort lids by size.Promising review: \"This product does exactly what it is supposed to and does it well. In under 15 minutes, I took my nightmare lid drawer and turned it into a functional, convenient storage space. The dividers were simple to install and provided flexibility. Slowly but surely I am getting my tiny, chaotic kitchen under control, and this got me a huge leap closer.\" \u2014 S. Hawthorn$19.99 at Amazon3Laha Corner / EtsyAn under-cabinet macrame fruit hammockLaha Corner is an Asian woman-owned Etsy small biz offering macrame goodies based in Hanoi, Vietnam. This basket comes with four adhesive hooks to hang the hammock and is available in two styles and 30 colors.Promising review: \"I loveee this little fruit hammock! We have a deep corner cabinet that this fit perfectly in. I love how it cleared up space on the counter AND even came with some adhesive hooks to hang it. Really love this!\" \u2014 Mackenzie Wieners$18.55+ at Etsy4www.amazon.comA roll-up sink dish rack that has a variety of usesAvailable in two sizes.Promising review: \"I am always amazed when I see someone has created a 'million dollar idea' in the simplest way. I like my counters free of clutter and I also do not like to store bulky dish drainers. I also do not want to buy plastic drainers. I have been using the standard dish towel to set wet dishes on the counter to dry. It takes up valuable real estate and leaves my counter cluttered and wet. This is the perfect solution for washing those few dishes that cannot go in your dishwasher or you just prefer to wash by hand (I have a few older dishes that I prize and prefer to hand wash). This little rack fits over my second sink. It's easy to let the wet dishes drip over the sink basin and dry. When not in use, it is easy to roll up and put away, not taking a lot of storage space. This is ideal for a small kitchen but is also perfect if you want a more minimal kitchen too. I like leaving it out as it becomes a place for a dish rag to dry, or for a hot pot/pan to sit before letting it rinse. Highly recommend!\" \u2014 Terry Childs$13.97+ at Amazon5www.amazon.comA two-tiered turntable that makes finding spices easyPromising review: \"This turned a mess of a cabinet into an organized cabinet. We use A LOT of spices and it was always a nightmare to find the right one. Now I just spin to find what I want. It\u2019s a nice height too and allows for different size bottles to be placed on the racks.\" \u2014 Vegmom$12.99+ at Amazon6www.amazon.comA sliding tray for your coffee pot, kettle and morePromising review: \"Such a simple idea but oh how helpful this is. My husband pulls the coffeemaker out from under the cabinet when it\u2019s brewing and forgets to put it back when it\u2019s done so I do it. The bottom of the coffee maker has a gripper on it so it sticks as I\u2019m trying to push it back and sometimes coffee sloshes out the top...Such a simple idea yet this rolling thing is fantastic and with one finger I can roll it back under and there\u2019s no sloshing. Even my husband, a born skeptic who thinks these kinds of things are just junk is showing people 'hey look at this' lol this is a keeper.\" \u2014 Kirsten$14.99 at Amazon7WayfairA portable kitchen island that doubles as a prep surfaceAvailable in three colors.Promising review: \"1) Sturdy AF! I\u2019m planning on cooking with it (among other things like eating dinner, etc), it\u2019s so sturdy that I feel extremely comfortable and safe doing so with this island. 2) Easy to put together. Took me ~30-45min. TLDR \u2014 would 1000% buy again and to the reviewers that convinced me to buy this product, thank you!\" \u2014 Nicole$219.99 at Wayfair8www.amazon.comAn adjustable pot and pan organizerPromising review: \"I live in a small studio apartment, with a correspondingly small kitchenette. I have a problem squatting down to reach the lower cabinets under my counter, so it seemed like I always had pans in the way of what I wanted to cook. Right now I have two cast iron fry pans with lids, and three pots of various capacities. So I went looking for some help in storing all of them. There are a whole bunch of racks similar to this one, but most either didn't meet my needs, didn't appear to be sturdy enough, or appeared to be knockoffs of this set. I chose this set as the best of the bunch, and it has worked out perfectly. The whole setup is extremely sturdy and well built, and was just a whiz to set up. I don't think it took me more than ten minutes to set it up and load it with all my pots and pans. Definitely a lifesaver and space saver for me.\" \u2014 Lonelydad$36.99+ at Amazon9www.amazon.comA sliding shelf that fits inside your cabinetAvailable in seven sizes.Promising review: \"After multiple attempts to organize my deep, narrow, hard to organize lower cabinet, where I keep pots and pans, I finally tried one of the Lynx sliding shelves. WHY didn\u2019t I just buy this to begin with?! I have these awful half-shelves in the lower cabinets that don\u2019t hold much and making organizing even more difficult. Reaching into these lower cabinets can be painful and maddening when you need one pan or pot, but you have to remove EVERYTHING, set them on the floor, grab the one item you need, and shove the stack back into the narrow and deep cabinet. THIS sliding shelf solves the problem!\" \u2014 Mustang Sally$44.80+ at Amazon10www.amazon.comA set of six easy-to-clean fridge drawersPromising review: \"I absolutely love these refrigerator pantry organizers. I purchased one set and after receiving it, I purchased a second. They are sturdy and fit well into my refrigerator and freezer. Prior to purchasing these my freezer was a nightmare! No matter how I placed food in the freezer I was always struggling with food falling out when I opened the door. With these organizers I am able to separate out my meat, fruit, vegetables, etc. Additionally, looking in the back of the freezer is as simple as using the organizer handle and pulling it out of the freezer. I highly recommend this product.\" \u2014 Amanda$22.99 at Amazon11Food52A fruit bowl with a cork topAvailable in two sizes and six colors.Promising review: \"This is a very stylish piece! And it serves double duty because it's both fashionable AND functional! I love the concept of having my own mini root cellar on my countertop and having fruit etc. displayed on the cork top is a nice feature. It's a quality piece \u2014 I love it!\" \u2014 Aktbell$110+ at Food5212www.amazon.comA magnetic spice rackPromising review: \"I freaking love these things. I needed to clean out a spice drawer and was looking for something clean, sleek, and modern to hold my eight or so most used spices within reach. These have a really strong magnet on the back and hold four tiny mason jars of spices beautifully on the side of my fridge. I bought two and have four jars in each one. I could probably stuff eight jars in one rack, but I like them spread out a bit. This is just so much cuter than anything else I found \u2014 others are all just way too country-crock for my style. These look way more expensive than they are and this is cheaper than the price on Food52 where I originally found them. Highly recommend!\" \u2014 Alyssa M.$25 at Amazon13www.amazon.comA pantry shelf organizer with multiple compartmentsAvailable in three sizes.Promising review: \"I am totally obsessed with thing. I went on a shopping spree this last week and out of all the things I bought, this thing brings me the most joy LOL. My snack cabinet has NEVER looked so organized. I ended up choosing the large size and was able to fit about TEN different boxes of snacks inside of it. I am beyond impressed and will be ordering another for my other cabinet.\" \u2014 Sara$19.99 at Amazon14www.amazon.comA pack of two rotating utensil hooksPromising review: \"I have a very small kitchen, and one small counter. These completely changed my life. I no longer have to move my jars of cooking utensils to the couch to food prep and cook. I hung these over a part of my sink so I also don't have to take up space in my tiny dish drying rack, I wash them and immediately hang them up to dry! They spin smooth, look nice and so far have stuck very well. I only have one spatula that doesn't have a big enough hole for the hooks, but the rest fit great!\" \u2014Shannon$13.99+ at Amazon15TargetAn affordable ice cube binPromising reviews: \"YES GET THIS. Get it with the matching covered ice cube tray that fits on top. It's PERFECT. I can't say enough good things about this. Such a perfect set for an amazing price.\" \u2014 WJL\"Perfect size for my freezer. It depends on what you consider small for freezer size. My fridge are double doors side by side so my freezer size is pretty small, to me. This bin is a genius way to hold my ready made ice as well as stabilizing my ice tray in the making. I love them.\" \u2014 Nx$4 at Target16www.amazon.comA combination rice dispenser and storage containerThis comes with a rice-draining cup and sponge brush for cleaning.Promising review: \"After running out of rice on Christmas and needing to make the arroz con gandules for dinner I knew I needed to stockpile rice to avoid that disaster in the future. I avoided buying the giant bags of rice at Costco in the past because I didn\u2019t have a good way to store it. But then I stumbled upon this thing! It is AWESOME! It holds a full 20 lbs bag of rice easily. The dispenser is super easy to use. The only suggestion I have is to put cup measurements on the dispensing pitcher. (I did this with a sharpie.) The pitcher has a mesh part at the top on one side so you can easily rinse your rice before cooking it. I highly recommend this rice dispenser!\" \u2014Melissa K$39.99 at Amazon17WayfairA wall-mounted mug shelfPromising review: \"Love it!!! Exactly what I wanted for my mug collection and coffee station. I love that it fits all my mugs and doesn\u2019t look bulky at all. I also love that I can nicely display all my mugs. It came in black and looked great but I wanted it in gold for my coffee station theme so I spray painted it and it looked perfect! Totally recommend it. Especially if you have an obsession with mugs like me.\" \u2014 Anonymous$32.99 at Wayfair18www.amazon.comAn under-the-sink organizer with a slide-out drawerPromising review: \"I ordered four of these. I really went ALL in on them. I highly recommend them. We put two under our kitchen sink and two under our bathroom sink. They fit really well and really ELEVATED the whole situation. I\u2019m so thankful for them. I keep opening our cupboards to admire how organized they look now!\" \u2014 Brittany$25.99 at Amazon19www.amazon.comA box that keeps bread fresh and adds more surface space to your counterPromising review: \"Love everything about this breadbox! The bamboo natural color, the non-slip feet, the magnets on the door, the lip around the top to keep anything from slipping off. I especially like the sturdy, semi-clear, wavy/lined section in the door \u2014 so much better quality than those with a thin clear plastic insert, and hides any mess. Quickly assembled using portable drill for the screws. Instructions with pictures made it easy. It is very roomy and yet takes up little space on the counter. It is currently easily holding two loaves of bread plus at least two containers of English muffins, and still some space left over. Magnets keep the door shut but aren't so strong that I have to wrestle or yank it open. It looks neat and elegant on the counter. No complaints or wishes about this box at all!\" \u2014 Vee$34.99+ at Amazon20TargetA two-tiered corner shelf that adds more storage to your pantryPromising review: \"This corner shelf came in handy for a few items. I used one for most needed and used spices in the kitchen. Another in the bathroom for my essential makeup that I did not want all over the sink. Another in the bedroom to store a few things out of the way. Good choice!! I like that you can fit it in the corner!!!\" \u2014 DW$15 at Target21www.amazon.comA deceptively sturdy wall-mounted pot rack with hooksAvailable in two colors. Promising review: \"We needed this rack in our kitchen as our cabinets started getting full of pots and pans all over the place including their lids. Our kitchen is small but this rack was the best thing we bought for our kitchen. Very robust metal construction, light for its size, and extremely easy to install. I had to drill six screws in the wall. One for each level and finally two more for the supporting bars that are extended to the front. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to organize their kitchens and have their pots and pans they use frequently at one spot.\" \u2014 Niklas Henricson$75.99+ at Amazon22www.amazon.comAn over-cabinet door plastic bag holderThe company will also ship you custom parts to hang the holder if it doesn't fit under your sink. It's available in two colors.Promising review: \"I always had to have a fight with the plastic bags under my sink, it drove me crazy. This fits over the under-sink cabinet door, and now I have one less thing that aggravates me! A must have!\" \u2014 SV$19.99 at Amazon23www.amazon.comA bakeware and cutting board organizerPromising review: \"I LOVE this organizer! I had been keeping my baking sheets/pans stacked in the oven and on a shelf \u2014 so I had to move lots of sheets/pans when I only needed one. Why was I doing this to myself? This organizer keeps the sheets vertical which makes it is easy to remove the *one* I need to use. Assembly was quick (less than five minutes); installation was also very quick \u2014 clearing out space in the cabinet to install the organizer took more time. The sliding mechanism works like a charm.\" \u2014 MD$59 at Amazon24Logo Bar Products / EtsyA mini counter caddyLogo Bar Products is a small biz and Etsy shop based in Florida that makes all kinds of custom barware and bar decor.

It's very nicely made. I have it in a cabinet to provide vertical storage for the microwave cover. Perfect for my use.\" \u2014 anonymous$35.99 at Wayfair26www.amazon.comA flexible sponge-holding sling that conforms to your kitchen sinkPromising review: \"Okay, I have had too many different sponge holders to even count. They all had suction cups that eventually stop sticking. I was looking for something that would do the job without a suction cup. Some had metal that rusted, some had an area to catch the drips and that area just got gross FAST! This is THE PERFECT sponge holder. It's completely flexible. You can widen the holder for larger sponges, bend it in just about anyway imaginable to fit any place. I have a double sink and a lot of the pictures showed it with a single sink. I bent mine (please see pictures) in a weird way, but let me tell you it works perfectly.\" \u2014 B.D.$4.99+ at Amazon27www.amazon.comAn extra large rotating utensil holderAvailable in plastic or stainless steel, and five colors.Promising review: \"I have found that the older you get the more utensils you acquire. I have bought several holders through the years and would need a bigger one each time I ran out of space as my utensil collection grew. I found this holder and it is perfect! It's big and holds a number of utensils. I love the dividers and that it swivels. The feet will not harm countertops. I absolutely love that it is dishwasher safe. I have placed it in the dishwasher and it came out clean and still perfect. I highly recommend this utensil holder! Save yourself some trouble and buy it because even if you don't have a large number of utensils now you will need the large space eventually.\" \u2014 Smiley$22.99+ at Amazon28West ElmA handcrafted wooden shelf that fits over your stoveReds Wood Design is a family-owned small biz based in South Florida creating handcrafted functional pieces for the home.

It is very important that everything that happened be preserved in these two centers.\u201dWhile Gorbachev didn\u2019t confirm how much he was paid, sources claimed he was reportedly paid nearly $1 million to do the advertisement, according to The New York Times. The commercial, which shows him dining at a Pizza Hut with his granddaughter Anastasia, debuted all over the world.However, in Russia Gorbachev was still unpopular at the time and the ad was not aired despite it being filmed in Moscow, The New York Times reported.Negotiations between Pizza Hut and Gorbachev took a bit of time because while he was willing to take the dough for the ad, he said \u201cnyet\u201d to eating the pizza on camera, according to reports.Advertisement\n\nHence, the casting of his granddaughter, who willingly chowed down on a slice to appease Pizza Hut executives, according to a 2019 deep dive into the commercial by Foreign Policy.Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, initially feared doing commercials would harm his reputation. But he ended up also doing a 2007 magazine ad for Louis Vuitton where he\u2019s sitting in a car next to remaining parts of the Berlin Wall.HuffPost reached out to Pizza Hut for comment, but no one immediately responded. Many Twitter users, on the other hand, had tons of saucy comments about Gorbachev\u2019s Pizza Hut past.My generation knew Communism was dead when we saw Gorbachev in a Pizza Hut commercial. Last few decades must have been awfully lonely and strange for Gorbachev. https://t.co/ax3v90sQxB\u2014 Sunanda Vashisht (@sunandavashisht) August 30, 2022\n\nAlso, apologies in advance if I caused you to learn of Gorbachev's death via a Pizza Hut ad\u2014 Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) August 30, 2022\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best way to honor the death of Mikhail Gorbachev would be for Pizza Hut to return to its 90s decor pic.twitter.com/iJsjJLhEdU\u2014 Adam Blickstein (@AdamBlickstein) August 30, 2022\n\n\"I'm at the Pizza Hut, I'm at the Taco Bell...I'm at Gorbachev's funeral at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell\"\u2014 Scott Matla (@scottmatla) August 30, 2022\n\nUnder Gorbachev Russia got to taste Pizza Hut and KFC.Under Putin, Pizza Hut and KFC left.pic.twitter.com/lOkSCBOtRS\u2014 David Leavitt (@David_Leavitt) August 30, 2022\n\nR.I.P.

    "maintext": "Gather round, young ones, here\u2019s a tale of a time before streaming. In the olden times of the mid-1990s, we had to endure moments away from our couches to venture to stores like Blockbuster to rent DVDs \u2014 small discs we would feed to machines to show us movies. While these stores were brimming with delicious candy, they also had gatekeepers \u2014 or clerks \u2014 who would shame us for enjoying the antics of an often forgotten talent named Pauly Shore. But all of this changed in 1998 when a company called Netflix allowed us to remain on our couches and create an online \u201cqueue\u201d of DVDs we could consume at our leisure. Advertisement\n\nFor 25 years, Netflix has allowed us to watch whatever trash we want 24 hours a day on-demand and without shame (just so long as it\u2019s available on the platform). A happy man, selecting a DVD at a video store, not yet aware of the shame he will soon endure.Matic Grmek via Getty ImagesThanks to Netflix, we could have movies like \u201cBio-Dome\u201d delivered to our mailboxes. Then streaming came along and for one flat subscription fee, we were able to watch multiple films in one day, over and over, without shame or the need to leave our couches. So, the concept of DVDs (and Blockbuster) eventually became obsolete.But we still have Netflix and to celebrate its 25th anniversary on Monday they provided users with a few interesting tidbits about the company. Advertisement\n\nDid you know the first Netflix DVD envelope was white, not red?Or that the iconic Netflix sound was nearly a bleating goat before we landed on TUDUM???Here are 4 more fun facts you may not know about Netflix: pic.twitter.com/WyeKtUxfQl\u2014 Netflix (@netflix) August 29, 2022\n\nThese include: The first DVD that Netflix ever shipped was \u201cBeetlejuice,\u201d Tim Burton\u2019s quirky 1988 comedy starring Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Catherine O\u2019Hara and Winona Ryder. Netflix mailed the movie on March 10, 1998. Netflix originally had a placeholder name of Kibble \u2014 like the dog food. The company included a mockup of what the Kibble label would have looked like. The company\u2019s original idea for its signature sound was a bleating goat noise, but opted for the more soothing \u201ctudum.\u201d  The service\u2019s earliest envelope was white and not red.  The most popular profile icon used around the world is the \u201cBoss Baby\u201d icon \u2014 which is used in a whopping 11 million profiles.  The show on Netflix with the most MyLists Adds is \u201cMoney Heist.\u201d Netflix also asked Monday in a follow-up tweet for old-school users to share the DVDs they \u201cforgot\u201d to return back in the day \u2014 promising those who participated would not get in trouble. We've all done it.

The Abilene-based nonprofit called the break-in \u201chorrific\u201d and announced that the escape left numerous dogs with injuries.ALL KINS has since raised $1,765, as of Tuesday night, funding that it promises will go to the care and assistance of impacted dogs along with clean-up and repairs at the shelter.Related...Ecuador Investigates Deaths Of 4 Galapagos Tortoises They Fear Were Hunted And EatenMysterious Illness Killing Dogs In Michigan Is Identified By State OfficialsDog Catches Monkeypox In France In First Suspected Human-To-Pet Transmission",

    "maintext": "A commission appointed to study the names of landmarks and memorials at West Point and the U.S. Naval Academy found a handful of Confederate dedications that should be removed, relocated or renamed, according to a report submitted to Congress on Monday.That includes numerous references to the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. At West Point, in New York\u2019s Orange County, Lee\u2019s name is affixed to five assets, including a preschool.Advertisement\n\n\u201cLee\u2019s armies were responsible for the deaths of more United States soldiers than practically any other enemy in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d the report notes.The names of lesser-known Confederate officers adorn other buildings that were also identified for renaming. That includes Beauregard Place, named for Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, and Hardee Place, named for Gen. William J. Hardee.The report identifies Beauregard with particular disdain, noting that he had \u201clong been an ardent supporter of enslavement, secession and rebellion.\u201d And while Beauregard did serve as superintendent at West Point, partially explaining his commemoration at the school, he only held the job for five days, after which he was fired, joined the Confederacy, and considered fleeing overseas in the wake of the Civil War.Ironically, one of the most egregious examples identified by the commission falls outside its purview. A marker mounted outside Bartlett Hall at West Point bears the words \u201cKu Klux Klan\u201d below a relief of a hooded figure carrying a rifle.Advertisement\n\nA naming commission took issue with various Confederacy-affiliated assets at West Point. At left, a marker at West Point bears the words \u201cKu Klux Klan\u201d below a relief of a hooded figure carrying a rifle.The Naming Commission\u201cThe marker falls outside the remit of the commission,\u201d the report notes. \u201cHowever, there are clearly ties in the KKK to the Confederacy.\u201dThe commission encouraged the U.S. secretary of defense \u2015 currently, retired Gen. Lloyd Austin \u2015 to remove the marker, and to standardize rules that would remove any similar references that exist elsewhere.At the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, the commission identified three assets for renaming.Both a road and a residence bearing the name of Franklin Buchanan, a Confederate admiral whose efforts \u201ckilled hundreds of U.S. Navy sailors,\u201d were recommended to be rededicated.Maury Hall, named after Matthew Maury, is also on the list. Maury rose to prominence as an oceanographer, then fell from grace in the Civil War while advocating for what the report describes as \u201ca series of vast American territories ... where enslaved humans would produce commodity crops.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, attempts to establish Confederate monuments at West Point and Annapolis were \u201cconsistently met with solid resistance\u201d for more than 60 years, the authors write. That changed with the \u201cLost Cause\u201d movement in the 1930s that sought to recast and romanticize a distorted history of Southern defeat.\u201cThe commissioners do not make these recommendations with any intention of \u2018erasing history,\u2019\u201d the panel wrote in the report. \u201cThe facts of the past remain and the commissioners are confident the history of the Civil War will continue to be taught at all service academies with all the quality and complex detail our national past deserves.\u201d \u201cRather, they make these recommendations to affirm West Point\u2019s long tradition of educating future generations of America\u2019s military leaders to represent the best of our national ideals,\u201d the report says. \u201cCadets of the present who devote their lives to national service should do so in an environment and setting that honors the greatest examples, traditions, and leaders of our past.\u201dRelated...Fort Benning Memorial Will Honor Black Soldier Who Was Lynched 80 Years AgoVirginia's 12-Ton Robert E.

    "maintext": "The last surviving member of the Monkees is hoping to get to the bottom of what FBI files say about the 1960s pop group.On Monday, drummer and singer Micky Dolenz filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking full access to the bureau\u2019s documents on the band, according to Law&Crime.Advertisement\n\nThe agency posted a redacted version of documents on the group in 2011, under the title \u201cAdditional Activities Denouncing the U.S. Policy in the War in Vietnam.\u201dPart of the text that is publicly visible features comments by an FBI informant who attended a 1967 concert and described \u201csubliminal messages\u201d on a screen behind the band that \u201cconstituted \u2018left wing innovations of a political nature.\u2019\u201dDuring the show, the screen showed messages and images related to the Vietnam War and civil unrest, according to the informant.Another file is completely redacted, according to the New York Post.The 77-year-old Dolenz had filed a Freedom of Information Act request in June but sued the FBI after failing to get a timely response, according to Billboard.Advertisement\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit is designed to obtain any records the FBI created and/or possesses on the Monkees as well as its individual members,\u201d the suit read.\u201cMr. Dolenz has exhausted all necessary required administrative remedies with respect to his FOIA/PA request,\u201d it added, referring to both the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act.Mark Zaid, a lawyer who filed the lawsuit on Dolenz\u2019s behalf, told Law&Crime that most people \u201cmight not think\u201d that the litigation \u201cwould reveal what our government was up to,\u201d but he said it shows that the FBI \u201cwas actively monitoring war dissenters, perceived radicals and anyone counter to [former bureau director] J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s cultural beliefs, and that included the Monkees!\u201dThe lawsuit also mentions that the FBI kept files on other rock icons like Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon.Dolenz had been unaware of the redacted documents until Zaid suggested that they research whether the FBI kept a file on his band, the lawyer told Rolling Stone.Advertisement\n\nThose redacted documents \u201cjust kind of reinforced for me that there was actually something here,\u201d Zaid said. \u201cWe\u2019re still fishing, but we know there\u2019s fish in the water.\u201dHe added: \u201cTheoretically, anything could be in those files. ... It could be almost nothing. But we\u2019ll see soon enough.\u201dThe FBI has not responded to numerous media inquiries about the documents, possibly because agents are jamming out to Monkees hits like \u201cI\u2019m a Believer,\u201d which you can listen to below.Related...Monkees Member Mike Nesmith Dies At 78Peter Tork Of The Monkees Dies",

According to an initial report in The Baltimore Banner on Saturday, police said a group of \u201cdrug dealers\u201d demanded $50,000 in weekly protection money for production to continue on the 200 block of Park Avenue downtown.Advertisement\n\nBaltimore Police Department spokesperson James Moses told the outlet producers declined to pay up and decided to move the shoot elsewhere instead.In a later statement to the Los Angeles Times on Sunday, police said the locals threatened producers, telling them they would \u201callow the production to continue\u201d if they were paid but would \u201ccome back later this evening [and] shoot someone\u201d if filming continued on the 200 block.Police spokesperson Chakia Fennoy told the LA Times \u201cleaders of the production decided to err on the side of caution and reschedule the shoot after they found another location.\u201dHowever, the production company, Endeavor Content, issued a statement to the LA Times with conflicting details of the incident. The company said no cast, crew or producers were on set at the time. Advertisement\n\n\u201cFriday afternoon, on the Baltimore set of our production Lady in the Lake, prior to the arrival of the cast and crew \u2026 a driver on our production crew was confronted by two men, one of whom brandished a gun directed at our driver, and then fled the location,\u201d Endeavor Content told the newspaper.Local WBAL-TV 11 reporter David Collins tweeted Monday that \u201cCity Police are investigating possible discrepancies in the extortion complaint.\u201dThe series is being adapted from a novel by Laura Lippman, a reporter-turned-author.Leonardo Cendamo via Getty Images\u201cWe are working with the Baltimore Police Department as the investigation is ongoing,\u201d Endeavor Content\u2019s statement said. \u201cThe safety and security of our crew, cast and all who work across our productions is our highest priority, and we are thankful no one was injured.\u201dThe series, adapted from a bestselling Laura Lippman novel, will star Portman as a Baltimore housewife investigating a local murder.

    "maintext": "Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) believed he would have the support of the Working Families Party in an open New York congressional seat, according to someone close to him.Jemal Countess/Getty ImagesFew would dispute that Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) got the raw end of New York\u2019s messy redistricting process. Faced with the prospect of running against either Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, House Democrats\u2019 deep-pocketed campaign chief, or fellow progressive Rep. Jamaal Bowman in a seat into which Jones\u2019 home had been drawn, Jones chose a third option: leaving the suburbs to run in an entirely new New York City district. In that congressional district \u2015 New York\u2019s 10th \u2015 Jones would end up coming in third place in the Democratic primary on Aug. 23, cutting short a celebrated career in Congress after just one term.Advertisement\n\nNow, some in Jones\u2019 inner circle are accusing the Working Families Party, a key progressive institution in New York, of leading Jones on about the support it was willing, or able, to deliver for him in the race.Someone familiar with Jones\u2019 conversations in late May when he was rolling out his campaign told HuffPost that Sochie Nnaemeka, New York state director of the Working Families Party, spoke with Jones directly, telling him that she would help him secure an endorsement from the WFP. The person familiar with Jones\u2019 discussions made clear that Nnaemeka never promised anything concrete. The person also could not recall whether that conversation took place immediately before or immediately after Jones\u2019 May 21 announcement of his candidacy.Shortly before Jones announced his run, Nnaemeka also told a person close to Jones that she would call state Assembly Member Yuh-Line Niou and discourage her from running, the person who spoke to Nnaemeka told HuffPost.Advertisement\n\nWith that in mind, Jones\u2019 decision to announce his run in New York\u2019s 10th in the wee hours of the morning after the final maps were announced on May 21 was designed to preempt an announcement by Niou later that day.As it turned out, Nnaemeka\u2019s help was not forthcoming, according to the two Jones allies. \u201cThe WFP wrote a check they couldn\u2019t cash,\u201d the Jones ally who spoke to Nnaemeka told HuffPost.Instead, the WFP\u2019s New York members voted to endorse Niou in late June. The WFP later spent $150,000 on a digital ad campaign in support of Niou\u2019s bid.An unaligned progressive New York strategist, who was in touch with Nnaemeka and the campaigns of several left-leaning candidates in New York\u2019s 10th at the time, also confirmed that Nnaemeka was telling Jones, his allies, and other progressives that she was supportive of his bid. \u201cI told Mondaire he would get a fair hearing in the WFP process, and walked him through how the process would go, and told him the best pitch I thought he could make to our members, just as I did with Yuh-Line and allies of Carlina\u2019s.\u201d- Sochie Nnaemeka, New York state director, Working Families PartyGiven his status as a WFP champion in Congress and an early endorsee in the 2020 election cycle, Jones and his allies would have preferred for the WFP to at least remain neutral in the race if the WFP did not endorse him, the two Jones allies told HuffPost.Advertisement\n\nJones has a close working relationship with the WFP dating to his 2020 bid for a seat in the northern suburbs of New York City. The WFP endorsed his run there in February 2020 \u2014 four months before a primary win in which he received 42% of the vote against seven other Democrats. And Jones remained a visible ally of the WFP in Washington. As Jones noted in his endorsement interview with the New York Times editorial board, he wore a WFP T-shirt while participating in Rep. Cori Bush\u2019s (D-Mo.) U.S. Capitol demonstration in favor of extending the federal eviction moratorium in July and August 2021.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of being a WFP champion if they won\u2019t have your back when it matters?\u201d the Jones ally who spoke to Nnaemeka told HuffPost.Nnaemeka denied that she told Jones that she would offer him help securing the WFP\u2019s endorsement or that she told someone close to him that she would try to nudge Niou out of the race.\u201cWhen Mondaire decided to run in the new 10th district, he called me asking for support in this new bid,\u201d Nnaemeka told HuffPost in a statement. \u201cI told him there were several progressive and WFP-aligned candidates considering a run there and he should not rush a decision without knowing the field and having conversations with leaders on the ground.\u201d Advertisement\n\n\u201cOnce again I urged him to reconsider\u201d running against Maloney in New York\u2019s 17th Congressional District, she added. (When New York state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi (D) decided to run against Maloney in New York\u2019s 17th, the WFP indeed backed her.)To the extent that Nnaemeka might have offered anything that could be interpreted as \u201chelp\u201d to Jones or his allies, she told HuffPost, she extended the same thing to the campaigns of Niou and New York City Council Member Carlina Rivera \u2014 another onetime WFP ally who ran in New York\u2019s 10th.\u201cI told Mondaire he would get a fair hearing in the WFP process, and walked him through how the process would go, and told him the best pitch I thought he could make to our members, just as I did with Yuh-Line and allies of Carlina\u2019s,\u201d Nnaemeka said.New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a long-standing WFP ally who worked closely with Nnaemeka on efforts to corral progressives in New York\u2019s 10th, confirmed Nnaemeka\u2019s account to HuffPost. He said he approached Jones with a similar message, albeit not as a representative of the WFP.Rep. Mondaire Jones (right) embraces Rep. Cori Bush after President Joe Biden announced an extension of the federal eviction moratorium in August 2021. He was sporting a Working Families Party T-shirt.Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/Associated PressAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, Nnaemeka recalls instructing the campaigns of Jones, Niou and Rivera to talk among themselves in the hopes that \u201cthey could agree not to run against one another.\u201d\u201cWFP publicly communicated our process and timeline which I also walked candidates through individually,\u201d Nnaemeka said. \u201cI continued to reach out to all the progressive elected officials and asked them to hold off pledging support to anyone, so we could try to rally around a single progressive candidate, precisely to avoid the situation we\u2019re now in.\u201dJones\u2019 allies\u2019 claims against the WFP follow signs of cooperation between Jones and the progressive group. Jones, who held the Working Families Party ballot line after securing it for a run in his previous district, ceded the ballot line to Niou on Wednesday. Niou and the WFP are in the process of deciding whether Niou should mount a general-election bid against former Donald Trump impeachment attorney Dan Goldman, the Democratic nominee in New York\u2019s 10th, on the WFP ballot line. But the WFP, which fashions itself the elder statesman of New York\u2019s rejuvenated activist left, is also enduring new scrutiny following progressive setbacks in several high-profile Empire State primaries. Advertisement\n\nThe New York WFP has a history of marshaling disparate forces on the left against common enemies, such as when it executed a two-year plan to force the dissolution of a rogue Democratic state Senate faction, the Independent Democratic Conference, and punish the Democrats who had participated in it. The WFP succeeded in ousting six of the IDC\u2019s eight former members in primaries in September 2018.The following election cycle, the New York WFP \u2014 now under Nnaemeka\u2019s leadership \u2014 convinced a weaker candidate to withdraw from a primary in which Jamaal Bowman was taking on then-Rep. Eliot Engel. With progressives united behind him, Bowman went on to defeat Engel by a wide margin.Some critics question whether the WFP\u2019s New York branch has, more recently, prioritized the views of its membership \u2014 a mix of rank-and-file activists and the leaders of nonprofits like Make the Road Action \u2014 over exercising leadership and rallying its own members behind smarter decisions. \u201cIt\u2019s the role of candidates to put themselves out there,\u201d said the unaligned New York progressive strategist who requested anonymity to protect their relationship with the WFP. \u201cIt\u2019s the role of political organizers and leaders in the parties to shape the field and weigh things together and organize in a way that puts the people who are principals in the best places to serve.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a through-line between how WFP managed to lose the mayoral, gubernatorial and the highest-profile congressional race within one year: cowardly indecisiveness and leadership that\u2019s too afraid to lead.\u201d- New York progressive strategistAdvertisement\n\nPrior to Goldman\u2019s victory in New York\u2019s 10th, New York City\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary in June 2021 was arguably the New York left\u2019s greatest disappointment. In that race, a ranked-choice contest, the WFP originally endorsed three candidates in April. The group, which has a rank-and-file membership but also acts as a signal transmitter for all progressives, instructed left-leaning New Yorkers to rank then-NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer first, nonprofit executive Dianne Morales second, and attorney Maya Wiley third. The WFP withdrew its endorsement of Stringer within weeks of the announcement, following an accusation of sexual harassment against the comptroller that he vehemently denied (and the credibility of which subsequently came into question). Three weeks before primary day, as Morales\u2019 campaign imploded under the weight of its own personnel scandal, the WFP announced that it was calling for progressive voters to rank Wiley first on their ranked-choice ballots. Ultimately, Eric Adams, a moderate, narrowly prevailed against former city sanitation chief Kathryn Garcia. Wiley, however, had come in a respectable second place on the first round of ranked-choice votes, prompting some critics to wonder whether a clearer and earlier consolidation behind Wiley would have clinched the race for her.The WFP\u2019s pattern of relative weakness continued during New York\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial primary earlier this year. New York Attorney General Letitia James, currently the highest-ranking elected official in the state to win on both the Democratic Party\u2019s and the Working Families Party\u2019s ballot lines, announced a primary challenge against New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in late October. Advertisement\n\nJames, however, did not have the progressive lane to herself. New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams jumped in the race in November. And in December, James, who never obtained the WFP\u2019s endorsement, dropped out.New York Assembly Member Yuh-Line Niou (left) stands with Jones (right) at a press conference criticizing rival Dan Goldman on Aug. 15. Goldman benefited from a crowded progressive lane.Mary Altaffer/Associated PressThe WFP ended up endorsing Williams in February. With a shoestring budget, Williams lost to Hochul in a blowout \u2014 getting just 19% of the vote compared with Hochul\u2019s 68%. (Rep. Tom Suozzi, who ran to the right of Hochul, received 13% of the vote.)Finally, in New York\u2019s 10th, the WFP again failed to either clear the field for a single progressive candidate or consolidate the candidates behind one another once Goldman took the lead and it became clear that the divided field would help him clinch the win. He ended up besting Niou by about 2 percentage points, supporting progressives\u2019 view that he would have lost against fewer candidates.\u201cThere\u2019s a through-line between how WFP managed to lose the mayoral, gubernatorial and the highest-profile congressional race within one year: cowardly indecisiveness and leadership that\u2019s too afraid to lead,\u201d the unaligned New York progressive strategist said.Advertisement\n\nThe moderate Democratic establishment does not suffer from analogous barriers to rapid action, the progressive strategist noted. The speed with which top Democrats have lined up behind Goldman ahead of a potential Niou challenge is a case in point.Lander, the NYC comptroller, agreed that the failure to consolidate in New York\u2019s 10th speaks to gaps in the New York left\u2019s capacity, but disputes the notion that the WFP failed to do its utmost to try.\u201cWe believed that if we could stick together, avoid a divided progressive field, and unify around one candidate, we could send a movement candidate to Congress. And I think the results show that was very likely true,\u201d he said. \u201cThat consolidation did not happen, of course, but it definitely was not for want of effort on the part of WFP and Sochie.\u201dLander, a resident of New York\u2019s 10th, declined to publicly endorse in the primary, but revealed to HuffPost whom he selected.\u201cOut of respect for Mondaire, Yuh-Line and Carlina, all of whom I admire tremendously, I didn\u2019t end up endorsing at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThough, by Election Day, it was pretty clear to me Yuh-Line was the strongest candidate, and I voted for her.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nRelated...Anti-Muslim Extremist Laura Loomer Loses GOP Florida PrimaryCarl Paladino, The Donald Trump Of Western New York, Loses GOP Primary For CongressGOP Hopes Cash Surge Can Salvage Senate Candidates\u2019 Struggles",

Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres said Pakistan\u2019s flooding, caused by weeks of unprecedented monsoon rains, were a signal to the world to step up action against climate change.Advertisement\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s stop sleepwalking toward the destruction of our planet by climate change,\u201d he said in a video message to an Islamabad ceremony launching the funding appeal. \u201cToday, it\u2019s Pakistan. Tomorrow, it could be your country.\u201dThis aerial view shows a flooded residential area in Dera Allah Yar town after heavy monsoon rains in Jaffarabad district, Balochistan province on Aug. 30.FIDA HUSSAIN via Getty ImagesMore than 33 million people, or one in seven Pakistanis, have been affected by the catastrophic flooding, which has devastated a country already trying to revive a struggling economy. More than 1 million homes have been damaged or destroyed in the past two and half months, displacing millions of people. Around a half million of those displaced are living in organized camps, while others have had to find their own shelter.Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif said the floods badly destroyed crops, and his government was considering importing wheat to avoid any shortage of food.Advertisement\n\nSharif said Pakistan was witnessing the worst flooding in its history and any inadvertent delay by the international community in helping victims \u201cwill be devastating for the people of Pakistan.\u201dHe promised funds from the international community would be spent in a transparent manner and that he would ensure all aid reaches those in need. \u201cThis is my commitment,\u201d he told reporters, saying his country is \u201cfacing the toughest moment of its history.\u201dAccording to initial government estimates, the devastation caused $10 billion in damage to the economy.\u201cIt is a preliminary estimate likely to be far greater,\u201d Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told The Associated Press. More than 160 bridges and more than 3,400 kilometers (2,100 miles) of road have been damaged.Although rains stopped three days ago, large swaths of the country remain underwater, and the main rivers, the Indus and the Swat, are still swollen. The National Disaster Management Authority on Tuesday warned emergency services to be on maximum alert, saying flood waters over the next 24 hours could cause further damage.Advertisement\n\nRescuers continued to evacuate stranded people from inundated villages to safer ground.

For us, this is no less than a national emergency,\u201d Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said Tuesday, urging the international community to give generously to the U.N. appeal.\u201cSince mid-June, in fact, Pakistan has been battling one of the most severe, totally anomalous cycles of torrential monsoon weather,\u201d he said. Rainfall during that time was three times the average, and up to six times higher in some areas, he said.The U.N. flash appeal for $160 million will provide food, water, sanitation, health and other forms of aid to some 5.2 million people, Gutteres said.Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe scale of needs is rising like the flood waters. It requires the world\u2019s collective and prioritized attention,\u201d he said.A day earlier, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s executive board approved the release of a much awaited $1.17 billion for Pakistan.The funds are part of a $6 billion bailout agreed on in 2019. The latest tranche had been on hold since earlier this year, when the IMF expressed concern about Pakistan\u2019s compliance with the deal\u2019s terms under the government of former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Khan was ousted through a no-confidence vote in the parliament in April.Pakistan has risked default as its reserves dwindle and inflation has spiraled, and to get the IMF bailout, the government has had to agree to austerity measures.Children walk past tents set up for people displaced due to flooding in Dera Allah Yar town after heavy monsoon rains in Jaffarabad district, Balochistan province on Aug. 30.FIDA HUSSAIN via Getty ImagesAdvertisement\n\nThe flooding catastrophe, however, adds new burdens to the cash-strapped government. It also reflects how poorer countries often pay the price for climate change largely caused by more industrialized nations. Since 1959, Pakistan is responsible for only 0.4% of the world\u2019s historic emissions blamed for climate change. The U.S. is responsible for 21.5%, China for 16.5% and the EU 15%.Several scientists say the record-breaking flooding has all the hallmarks of being affected by climate change.\u201cThis year, Pakistan has received the highest rainfall in at least three decades,\u201d said Abid Qaiyum Suleri, executive director of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute and a member of Pakistan\u2019s Climate Change Council. \u201cExtreme weather patterns are turning more frequent in the region and Pakistan is not an exception.\u201dPakistan saw similar flooding and devastation in 2010 that killed nearly 2,000 people. But the government didn\u2019t implement plans to prevent future flooding by preventing construction and homes in flood prone areas and river beds, said Suleri.Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten contributed to this story from Geneva.Related...Pakistan Flooding Deaths Pass 1,000 In 'Climate Catastrophe'Police File Terrorism Charges Against Pakistan's Ex-Premier Imran Khan5 Things That Have Happened In Afghanistan Since The U.S. And Its Allies Withdrew Go To HomepageBefore You GoSuggest a correctionMore:Climate ChangePakistanislamabadPopular in the Community",

    "maintext": "Iraqi security forces fire tear gas on the followers of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr inside the government Palace, Baghdad, Iraq, on Aug. 29, 2022. Al-Sadr, a hugely influential Shiite cleric, announced he will resign from Iraqi politics and his angry followers stormed the government palace in response. The chaos Monday sparked fears that violence could erupt in a country already beset by its worst political crisis in years. AP Photo/Hadi MizbanBAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 An influential Iraqi cleric called on his supporters to withdraw Tuesday from the capital\u2019s government quarter, where they have traded heavy fire with security forces in a serious escalation of a monthslong political crisis gripping the nation.In a televised speech, Muqtada al-Sadr gave his supporters an hour to leave \u2014 and minutes later some could be seen abandoning their positions on live television. Iraq\u2019s military just announced end to curfew, further raising hopes that there might be an end to the street violence.Advertisement\n\nThe unrest began Monday, when al-Sadr announced he would resign from politics and his supporters stormed the Green Zone, once the stronghold of the U.S. military that\u2019s now home to Iraqi government offices and foreign embassies. At least 30 people have been killed, officials said.\u201cThis is not a revolution,\u201d al-Sadr said in a televised address, which followed pleas for restraint and peace from several Iraqi officials and the United Nations.Iraq\u2019s government has been deadlocked since al-Sadr\u2019s party won the largest share of seats in October parliamentary elections but not enough to secure a majority government \u2014 unleashing months of infighting between different Shiite factions. Al-Sadr refused to negotiate with his Iran-backed Shiite rivals, and his withdrawal Monday catapulted Iraq into political uncertainty.Iran closed its borders to Iraq on Tuesday \u2014 a sign of Tehran\u2019s concern that the chaos could spread, though even before al-Sadr\u2019s order, streets beyond the capital\u2019s government quarter largely remained calm. The country\u2019s vital oil continued to flow, with global benchmark Brent crude trading slightly down.Advertisement\n\nEarlier Tuesday, supporters of al-Sadr could be seen on live television firing both machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades into the heavily-fortified area through a section of pulled-down concrete walls. Security forces armed with machine guns inside the zone sporadically returned fire.Iraqi mourners attend a mass funeral, for supporters of Shiite leader Moqtada Sadr who were killed during clashes in Baghdad's Green Zone, at a cemetery in the central Iraqi city of Najaf on Aug. 30, 2022. ALI NAJAFI via Getty ImagesSome bystanders filmed the gunfight with their mobile phones, though most hid behind still-standing segments of wall, wincing when rounds cracked nearby. As al-Sadr\u2019s forces fired, a line of armored tanks stood on the other side of the barriers that surround the Green Zone, though they did not use their heavy guns.At least one wounded man from al-Sadr\u2019s forces was taken away in a three-wheel rickshaw, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry visible in the background. Heavy black smoke at one point rose over the area, visible from kilometers (miles) away.At least 30 people have been killed and over 400 wounded, two Iraqi medical officials said. The toll included both al-Sadr loyalists killed in protests the day before and clashes overnight. Those figures are expected to rise, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to release the information to journalists.Advertisement\n\nMembers of Iraq\u2019s majority Shiite Muslim population were oppressed when Saddam Hussein ruled the country for decades. The 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam, a Sunni, reversed the political order. Just under two-thirds of Iraq is Shiite, with a third Sunni.Now, the Shiites are fighting among themselves after the Americans largely withdrew from the nation, with Iranian-backed Shiites and Iraqi-nationalist Shiites jockeying for power, influence and state resources.It\u2019s an explosive rivalry in a country where many remain way of the Iranian government\u2019s influence even though trade and ties remain strong between its peoples. Iraq and Iran fought a bloody war in the 1980s that saw a million people killed.Al-Sadr\u2019s nationalist rhetoric and reform agenda resonates powerfully with his supporters, who largely hail from Iraq\u2019s poorest sectors of society and were historically shut out of the political system under Saddam.Al-Sadr\u2019s announcement that he is leaving politics has implicitly given his supporters the freedom to act as they see fit.Advertisement\n\nIranian state television cited unrest and a military-imposed curfew in Iraqi cities for the reason for the border closures. It urged Iranians avoid any travel to the neighboring country. The decision came as millions were preparing to visit Iraq for an annual pilgrimage to Shiite sites, and Tehran encouraged any Iranian pilgrims already in Iraq to avoid further travel between cities.Kuwait, meanwhile, called on its citizens to leave Iraq. The state-run KUNA news agency also encouraged those hoping to travel to Iraq to delay their plans.The tiny Gulf Arab sheikhdom of Kuwait shares a 254-kilometer- (158-mile-) long border with Iraq.The Netherlands evacuated its embassy in the Green Zone, Foreign Affairs Minister Wopke Hoekstra tweeted early Tuesday.\u201cThere are firefights around the embassy in Baghdad. Our staff are now working at the German embassy elsewhere in the city,\u201d Hoekstra wrote.Dubai\u2019s long-haul carrier Emirates stopped flights to Baghdad on Tuesday over the ongoing unrest. The carrier said that it was \u201cmonitoring the situation closely.\u201d It did not say when flights would resume.Advertisement\n\nOn Monday, protesters loyal to al-Sadr pulled down the cement barriers outside the government palace with ropes and breached the palace gates. Many rushed into the lavish salons and marbled halls of the palace, a key meeting place for Iraqi heads of state and foreign dignitaries.

Russia said it repelled the attack and inflicted heavy casualties.The clashes took place in the country\u2019s Kherson region, where Moscow\u2019s forces rolled up major gains early in the war. But Ukrainian authorities kept the world guessing about their intentions.Advertisement\n\nWhile independent verification of battlefield action has been difficult, Britain\u2019s Defense Ministry said in an intelligence report that several Ukrainian brigades had stepped up their artillery fire in front-line sectors across southern Ukraine.The port city of Kherson, with a prewar population of about 300,000, is an important economic hub close to the Black Sea and the first major city to fall to the Russians in the war that began six months ago. The port remains at the heart of Ukraine\u2019s efforts to preserve its vital access to the sea, while Russia views it as a key point in a land corridor extending from its border to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized in 2014.Occupation forces have spoken of plans to hold a referendum on making the Kherson region a part of Russia and have pressured residents to take Russian citizenship and stop using Ukraine\u2019s currency.Sunflowers grow amidst the rubble of Vladimir's house after being bombed by Russians in Chernihiv, Ukraine, on Aug. 29, 2022.

Tough battles are ongoing practically across all\u201d of the area. Ukrainian forces, the office said, destroyed ammunition depots and all large bridges across the Dnieper River vital to supplying Russian troops.The Ukrainian military also reported destroying a pontoon bridge on the Dnieper that the Russian forces were setting up and hitting a dozen command posts with artillery fire.Russian state news agency Tass that reported explosions rocked Kherson on Tuesday morning \u2014 most likely caused by air defense systems.Alluding to the talk of a major counteroffensive, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address on Monday that one \u201cwon\u2019t hear specifics from any truly responsible person\u201d about Kyiv\u2019s intentions, \u201cbecause this is war.\u201dThe British said that the most of Russia\u2019s units around Kherson \u201care likely under-manned and are reliant upon fragile supply lines\u201d while its forces there are undergoing a significant reorganization.Advertisement\n\nVladimir, 66, stands next to the wreckage of his house after being bombed by Russians in Chernihiv, Ukraine, on Aug. 29, 2022.

Emilio Morenatti via APRussian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov maintained that its forces stood up well and that Ukraine lost hundreds of troops, tanks and other armored vehicles in Monday\u2019s action. His claim could not be independently verified.Ukrainian independent military analyst Oleh Zhdanov told The Associated Press that \u201cit will be possible to talk about the effectiveness of Ukrainian actions only after large cities are retaken.\u201d He added that Ukrainian forces had breached the first and the second lines of defense in the Kherson region several times in the past, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t bring about results.\u201d\u201cThe most important thing is Ukrainian artillery\u2019s work on the bridges, which the Russian military can no longer use,\u201d Zhdanov said.The war has ground to a stalemate over the past months, with casualties and destruction rising and the population bearing the brunt of the suffering during relentless shelling in the east and south.Advertisement\n\nAmid fears that the fighting around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant could lead to a catastrophe, a U.N. atomic energy agency team set out on a mission to inspect and safeguard the complex. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the area over and over.Nikopol, a city just across the Dnieper from the plant, again came under a barrage of heavy shelling, local authorities said, with a bus station, stores and a children\u2019s library damaged. And a Russian missile strike targeted the city of Zaporizhzhia, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the plant, Ukraine said.In other developments:\u2014The first ship carrying grain from war-torn Ukraine for people in the hungriest parts of the world docked at the Horn of Africa port of Djibouti as deadly drought and conflict grip East Africa.

Lindsey Graham: He proved the president\u2019s point about Republicans who follow Donald Trump.Last Thursday, during a fundraising event, Biden said that the MAGA movement and its promotion of authoritarianism was basically \u201csemi-fascism.\u201dAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI underestimated how much damage the previous four years had done in terms of America\u2019s reputation in the world,\u201d the president said, before expressing hope things could be reversed.Biden got many members of the GOP in a tizzy, such as New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R), who, on Sunday, demanded the president apologize for \u201ctrying to stir up this anti-Republican sentiment right before the election.\u201dBut Biden got some unintentional support from Graham, his former friend-turned-Trump-sycophant.The South Carolina Republican helped Biden\u2019s cause by ominously threatening \u201criots in the streets\u201d if Trump is indicted for taking classified documents to Mar-a-Lago.On Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Graham\u2019s remarks on Sunday proved the point Biden said last week.Advertisement\n\n\u201cWe have seen MAGA Republicans attack our democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have seen MAGA Republicans take away our rights.

Trump\u2019s legal team has called for a special master to review the highly-sensitive government documents that the FBI seized when agents executed a search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago home. But Maddow said the purpose of the tactic was \u201cto delay the Justice Department in its ability to use the documents that they took from Mar-a-Lago as part of their ongoing criminal investigation. They\u2019re trying to delay it and make it more complicated.\u201d Advertisement\n\nNow, Maddow said, the Justice Department has to wait for a judge to determine what rules they will need to follow when handling those documents. \u201cThis can be made to seem more complicated than that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that is really what it boils down to. The Trump side wants to make it more slow and complicated for prosecutors to use the materials they seized, the DOJ doesn\u2019t want that.\u201d See her full analysis below: The Justice Department announced this week that it had already reviewed the documents and found \u201ca limited set of materials that potentially contain attorney-client privileged information.\u201d Advertisement\n\nThe DoJ is expected to file a brief up to 40 pages long on Tuesday in opposition of the Trump request for a special master, with a hearing set for Thursday.

    "maintext": "The tampon in the author's daughter's firetruck. Photo Courtesy Of Sarah SahagianMy daughter is crying. Like most toddlers, she has big feelings about snacks, which books to read when mommy or daddy should be allowed to leave the room, and what I, her mother, should wear. On this occasion, she\u2019s sad because we\u2019ve run out of her beloved granola bars and I\u2019ve yet to make it to the store to replenish our supply. Fortunately, I know what will make my 2-year-old feel better.Advertisement\n\n \u201cWould you like to hold your tampon?\u201d I ask. The answer to the above question is always, \u201cYeah!\u201d For the past few weeks, my daughter has taken what we call her \u201cemotional support tampon\u201d everywhere. For example, the tampon made it to soccer practice and accompanied my kid while creating chalk drawings at the park. It occupies the same role in her life as a \u201cbinkie\u201d or a \u201cblankey\u201d does for other kids. The only difference? My child\u2019s \u201cemotional support tampon\u201d attracts far more side-eye than a pacifier.My kid\u2019s relationship with her tampon began when she saw one that had gotten loose on the counter in the bathroom. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, admiring the multi-colored wrapper. \u201cIt\u2019s a tampon,\u201d I said, matter-of-factly. Next, my child wanted to know what it was for. I hadn\u2019t thought about when and how I\u2019d introduce my offspring to the concept of menstruation, but I made the game-time decision not to start with a lie. In case she remembered this conversation years from now, in the recesses of her mind, I wanted to be as truthful as possible.\u201cUm, it\u2019s sort of like a Band-Aid for the inside. People who have uteruses bleed sometimes, and tampons help us deal with that.\u201d Do I think my child understood this explanation? Definitely not! Nonetheless, I liked the precedent it set in our household \u2015 one of openness about menstruation. Advertisement\n\nOf course, not everyone approves of our family\u2019s decision to be so honest about periods. Once, at the park, a 5-year-old boy sharing the swing set with my daughter pointed to the tampon and sweetly asked what it was. I looked over at his father with an expression that said, \u201cIs it OK if I tell him? Or would you prefer to do it yourself?\u201d Unfortunately, Park Dad\u2019s answer was this: \u201cI think kindergarten is a little young for risqu\u00e9 subjects like that.\u201d I didn\u2019t push the \u201cmenstrual products\u201d conversation with Park Dad. After all, becoming persona non grata at a playground is the worst possible fate when you have a 2-year-old. But I did wonder how anyone could think explaining the purpose of tampons was risqu\u00e9? It\u2019s not like I was recapping the plot of an erotic thriller.Indeed, the attitude that menstruation is a dirty secret that should be kept from children has real consequences. Keeping kids in the dark about body changes and reproduction can lead to real confusion when puberty begins. Research reveals many young people do not know what is happening when they get their first periods. How terrifying is that? Suddenly bleeding out of your vagina \u2015 and not knowing why \u2015 is a traumatic experience. It might even make a kid think they\u2019re injured or dying.I went through early puberty. When I was 10 years old, I was the first of my pals to start my period. While I technically knew what it was, I was too embarrassed to tell anyone. As a consequence, I walked around with bloody underwear for days. Advertisement\n\nSometimes I wonder whether I would have felt less humiliated by my period if the culture surrounding menstruation hadn\u2019t been so secretive. I can\u2019t remember the women in my family or my friends\u2019 families speaking openly about topics like PMS, periods, or menopause. And the men I knew were even worse! I once saw an older male relative have to leave the room during a maxi-pad commercial. He was a father of two, but I guess the bleeding part of the reproductive journey was too much for him.During puberty, my friends and I pieced together snippets of information from Tampax ads we saw during Oprah\u2019s commercial breaks. But my daughter\u2019s fascination with tampons has inspired me to be transparent about things period-related. I believe the cultural discomfort surrounding menstrual products \u2015 and the periods they exist to deal with \u2013 is a symbol of our general discomfort with the idea that our children will one day go through puberty, grow up, and explore their sexuality. But children of all genders will be affected by menses \u2015 either because they\u2019ll one day have periods, or because they\u2019ll know people who do. Shouldn\u2019t they be prepared?I hope that by never making tampons a taboo, my daughter will feel more empowered to discuss menstruation, puberty and sexuality in general. I hope she\u2019ll feel confident enough to ask any question that comes to her because I think it\u2019s important to prepare kids to become sexually healthy adults. It is simply my goal to raise a kid who is familiar with the language of menstruation from day one. I\u2019d rather not raise a person who worries they\u2019re bleeding to death when they reach menarche or who is afraid to ask for a tampon like I was. Instead, I\u2019m happy to be raising my little tampon enthusiast.

    "maintext": "The author and her then-fiance Sean posing for an engagement photo in February 2015.Courtesy of Sun Yen Cumby\u201cAre you happy?\u201d a friend asked while we were having dinner one evening. I didn\u2019t even know how to respond to that question. All I could say was, \u201cIt\u2019s different,\u201d and without warning, I started crying. These were tears being shed for all the pain and emotional strife I\u2019d endured, and all the things I\u2019d had to let go of and give up to be standing where I was at that moment after my husband Sean died four years earlier.Advertisement\n\nAt 39 years old, I unexpectedly became a young widow, alone for the first time in over 14 years. I\u2019ve always prided myself on being a very independent and self-sufficient woman who had a career, identity and life outside of the one she had with her husband. However, after Sean\u2019s passing, I realized that I had never \u201cadulted\u201d without him and that we were more co-dependent than I had thought.Even simple decisions like \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d had been made jointly, and now I had to go through the hardest, most painful and traumatic experience of my life alone. The confident, independent and self-sufficient woman I had been was nowhere to be found. Instead, there was a terrified woman who couldn\u2019t leave her house without suffering a panic attack.Most people think the hardest part of widowhood is the pain and grief of losing your life partner. Indeed, the depth and rawness of that pain and those emotions were nothing I\u2019d ever experienced before. Grief is a great equalizer \u2015 it can feel unrelenting and never-ending, and it doesn\u2019t seem to get profoundly better or easier with time. It only becomes more manageable as you learn to live, move and evolve with it.Grief becomes a part of who you are, but it\u2019s still not the hardest part of widowhood. For me, the hardest part was when I was faced with big questions like, \u201cWhat\u2019s next? How do I move forward alone? How do I even begin to pick up the shattered pieces of my life?\u201d Advertisement\n\nI spent the first nine months of widowhood drowning in grief, suffering from PTSD, feeling like all eyes were always on me. I could barely breathe, and normal, everyday routines were challenging. I was uncomfortable in my own skin, and most days, I was just standing still \u2015 scared to make a move while the rest of the world sped past me. I\u2019d spend each evening staring at the front door, willing my husband to come home, but he never did. The only way I was able to cope and get out of bed every morning was to tell myself he was on a very extended business trip. During that first year after Sean\u2019s death, I was essentially living the same life I had before, except without a husband. I started doing all his chores and picking up his slack. Nobody probably would have even noticed he had died if it weren\u2019t for my newly formed social ineptitude.In public, I felt awkward, and even people I had known for decades felt like strangers to me. In private, I felt like a caged bird constantly struggling to escape my pain by continually crashing against a closed window. There seemed to be no cure for the sadness, longing and loneliness I constantly felt. The author and her husband Sean at their wedding tea ceremony in June 2015.Courtesy of Sun Yen CumbyI needed to find a way to accept that I wasn\u2019t a wife anymore \u2015 even if I was still wearing my wedding ring and talking about my husband in the present tense. It was almost impossible at first. Sean\u2019s presence was very much alive in the house, but I was living alone. Our five pets and I even continued to sleep in our normal position as if he was still in bed with us.Advertisement\n\nI lived like this for almost three years after he passed, straddling the gray area between being married and single. Whether I wanted to or not, I had to make some serious mental, physical and emotional shifts if I wanted to survive. Eventually, I discovered that reading memoirs, stories and quotes on grief and other widows\u2019 experiences helped. I found solace in artist and author Vivian Greene\u2019s declaration that \u201cLife isn\u2019t about waiting for the storm to pass. It\u2019s about learning how to dance in the rain.\u201d So, that\u2019s what I finally did: I danced in the rain and mustered the courage and strength to push beyond the boundaries of my fear.Some days, I was successful, but most days, I usually ended up in tears at some point. Still, I refused to give up. I learned to get very comfortable with always being uncomfortable. \u201cFor me, the hardest part was when I was faced with big questions like, 'What\u2019s next? How do I move forward alone?'\u201dThen, a couple months into my second year of widowhood, everything suddenly turned upside-down with the arrival of COVID-19. With the world preoccupied and distracted by the pandemic, the relentlessly watchful eyes that normally kept tabs on me were turned elsewhere. I finally had the time, space and privacy to process and reflect on my grief in a deeper and more meaningful way without feeling judged or scrutinized by those around me.Advertisement\n\nWhat I learned during those first few months of isolation was that I had barely scratched the surface of my grief. I was too afraid to look at my trauma head-on, and for the first time in over two years, being a widow took a backseat to other parts of my life. I realized I was living in a house that was too big for me and working in a role I was ready to leave. By June 2020, I had listed my house for sale, moved into a rental unit, and started a new job. By October of that year, I had grown increasingly lonely and still felt frustrated, stuck and empty. Although I had made some significant mental and physical shifts in my grief process, I still wasn\u2019t able \u2015 or maybe was unwilling \u2015 to make the emotional shift toward rebuilding a new life without Sean. The social isolation I was experiencing coupled with having few physical attachments to my old life led me to make an impulsive decision to put my things in storage and move 400 miles to temporarily shelter in place with my parents. At 42, I was a boomerang child, living at home again.After a few months, I realized the only reason I was in this situation was due to my husband\u2019s death. It made my life seem even more tragic. Although I relished in the newfound joy of living closer to family, I couldn\u2019t help but look at my life through the rearview mirror and fixate on all the things I had lost. I spent the following year sitting squarely in the middle of my pain \u2015 I was disillusioned, hopeless and resigned to believing there was no light at the end of my tunnel.

I now see my third year as a valuable recovery period when I caught my breath, recalibrated and truly started the rebuilding process. Although I had found the courage to approach my grief head-on, too often, I had only focused on the path ahead of me along the seemingly insurmountable mountain I still had to ascend, or the path behind me, which was littered with my suffering and all the things I had to give up. I never took the time to appreciate all the things I had accomplished.When I finally stopped, stepped back and looked around, I was taken aback by the beautiful and lush terrain that surrounded me. I couldn\u2019t believe I had traversed through all those peaks and valleys for the last four years. By expanding my vantage point, I was able to find gratitude, appreciation and beauty not only in my achievements \u2015 no matter how big or small \u2015 but also in the loss, pain and struggle, which in turn allowed me to find and have patience, compassion and empathy for myself. Now, I can see I have gained as much as I have lost. I experienced a love so strong and powerful that even in death, it continues to grow, deepen and transcend. I possess a strength, courage and resilience that I didn\u2019t know was possible. I have a support system that came to my aid when I couldn\u2019t take care of myself. I have a group of family and friends who were present to witness my grief by laughing and crying with me without judgment or trying to make me feel better.And, most importantly, I realized I was never walking alone. Sean\u2019s presence was always beside me, holding my hand, carrying me when I couldn\u2019t walk on my own and guiding me through the pain and darkness. This newly found sense of appreciation and gratitude has made me realize that there are two sides to grief. Yes, there is pain, sadness, loss and fear, but immense love, strength, courage, resilience and healing can also be found.As I embark on my fourth year of widowhood, I do not know what\u2019s ahead. But I know I will stop fixating solely on my loss, pain and challenges, and focus more on the love, strength and memories Sean and I shared. I will tell my story whenever possible in hopes it may help someone else who is grieving to find hope, strength and the courage to keep moving forward. And I will keep exploring my own grief to learn new lessons and gain more understanding as I patiently welcome the healing I know will continue to come my way.Advertisement\n\nSun Yen Cumby is a numbers girl by profession and geeks out on converting data into intelligent decision-making tools.

    "maintext": "The author (right) with her brother and sister during a visit in New York City in 2002.Courtesy of Sarah LeibovMy father wasn\u2019t the one who told me I had a secret sister.On a summer day in 2000, when I was 24 years old, I was out buying pillows for the apartment I had just moved to with my fianc\u00e9. My mom called me on my cell, and I heard a strange, nervous excitement in her voice. I stopped on the sidewalk with my shopping bags to listen.\u201cI\u2019m not sure how to say this,\u201d she said. \u201cYour dad has been keeping something from you.\u201dI wondered what she could be talking about. She and my father had been divorced almost 20 years and barely spoke. Advertisement\n\n\u201cYou have a sister. She was placed for adoption after your dad impregnated his girlfriend, long before he met me,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is moving to New York and planning to stop here in Chicago in a few days. Your brother and I thought you might like to meet her.\u201dMy brother knew? I asked if my father had told him, but she said no. \u201cYour brother was going through your dad\u2019s briefcase seven years ago and discovered letters from your sister,\u201d she told me. \u201cThen your brother started corresponding with her secretly. Once I saw an email on his computer and asked who it was from, and he swore me to secrecy.\u201d\u201cSo, Dad doesn\u2019t know you two know?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo, I doubt he even knows your sister is coming to town,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want to meet her?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll call you back later,\u201d I told her before hanging up.I only noticed that I was crying when people passing me on the street gave me sympathetic looks. I sat down on the curb, shaking. I was in shock, but another part of me was relieved. Intuitively, I\u2019d always felt that my father was hiding something from me. Hearing the news validated the fear I\u2019d buried inside for years.I was confused as to why he had kept this secret. My parents had divorced and married other partners when I was young, and I\u2019d already had every kind of sibling imaginable \u2015 my brother, a stepsister from my mother\u2019s next marriage, and three half siblings from my father\u2019s second marriage. Why would he keep quiet about this one? I didn\u2019t know why my brother had never confronted my father, or shared the news with me. It was betrayal after betrayal.Advertisement\n\nWhen my fianc\u00e9 heard how upset I was, he came to pick me up. As I unpacked the new items I\u2019d purchased for the home we were building together, the shock about my past hit me in waves. It dawned on me that I was no longer who I believed myself to be \u2015 my father\u2019s firstborn child. One of my earliest memories of my father is sitting on his lap and hearing him say that his father never told him that he loved him, and he was going to make a point of telling me that he loved me. He took me to fun restaurants and musicals, like \u201dAnnie\u201d and \u201dA Chorus Line.\u201d I took comfort in being his first born even when he got remarried and had more children, and our dates \u2015 our special father-daughter time \u2015 fell away.Despite an unstable childhood split between two different households, I thought I knew my place. Now I didn\u2019t know anything at all. I didn\u2019t want to meet my father\u2019s hidden daughter behind his back, or hide it from him, as he had from me.\u201cMy parents had divorced and married other partners when I was young, and I\u2019d already had every kind of sibling imaginable \u2015 my brother, a stepsister from my mother\u2019s next marriage, and three half siblings from my father\u2019s second marriage. Why would he keep quiet about this one?\u201dI called my brother and told him, \u201cCall Dad now, and tell him what you know, or I will.\u201d The next day, my father asked my brother and me to meet him at a deli I\u2019d never heard of. I suspect he thought I wouldn\u2019t make a scene in an unfamiliar public setting, but I upset his plan. Tears flowed down my face as I ignored inquisitive looks from people trying to enjoy their matzo ball soup.Advertisement\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d I sobbed. \u201cBecause I knew you would react like this,\u201d he responded.My brother nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t tell you earlier. I was afraid to upset you, and besides, I knew Dad would be mad if he knew I had gone through his things.\u201dHearing this made me angry and defensive. I was often referred to as the sensitive one in my family and made to feel as though feelings were not OK to have. So it was my fault that they had lied to me?\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d I finally told my brother. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be upset with you. It wasn\u2019t your responsibility to tell me, it was Dad\u2019s. And perhaps if he had told me earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have reacted like this.\u201dMy father told us that when his girlfriend discovered that she was pregnant, she told him that she was moving to another state and planned to place the baby for adoption. Two decades later, my sister gained access to her adoption papers and reached out to both her birth parents. My father had then started corresponding with her and even met with her several times over the years. \u201cWhen were you planning to tell us?\u201d I asked.He shrugged. \u201cProbably never. She\u2019s a wonderful person though, and oddly enough, she looks just like you, Sarah. If you want to meet her, you don\u2019t need my permission.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nI was jealous of this phantom look-alike sister, and my feelings puzzled me. I had never felt that way about any of my other siblings. I was debating whether I should meet her when a friend, an only child, changed my perspective.\u201cDo you know how happy I would be to learn that I had a sibling?\u201d she said, \u201cWhat an incredible gift you\u2019ve been given.\u201d Her comments gave me pause. Eleven years earlier, I\u2019d lost a younger sister to a rare genetic disease. How could I turn down the opportunity to meet someone who shared the same connection to me?My fianc\u00e9 and I met my new sister at a restaurant the following evening. My father was right \u2015 she was lovely, kind and unassuming. I noticed that we both had inherited my father\u2019s dark eyes and curly hair. She seemed a bit nervous and just as intent on making a good impression as I was. In her warm presence, all my envy disappeared. In the years since, we have bonded over our mutual interests in music and meditation, both on the phone and in person. I am very fond of her, but it\u2019s so much more than that. I admire her political activism and ideals. She is a health care worker, and I\u2019ve never heard her blame anyone for the difficulties she has endured. She lives with an easy, open acceptance that is challenging for me.Advertisement\n\nTwenty years after meeting my sister, my world was rocked again when I received a similar phone call from my mother. This time, it was her turn to be surprised by the discovery of a new family member. She was notified by Ancestry.com that she was a close genetic match to a woman she didn\u2019t recognize.My grandparents had passed away years before, so there wasn\u2019t anyone to confirm this biological connection. When Mom showed me the woman\u2019s photo on Facebook, my breath caught in my throat. She had red hair and a dreamy, far-off look on her face that I recognized all too well \u2015 she was a dead ringer for my mother. Geneticists confirmed our suspicions days later on a conference call. They are half-sisters. Unlike my father, who had impregnated a girlfriend as a young man, my grandfather had an affair during his marriage to my grandmother. My mother and her sister were born only a few months apart, but on opposite sides of the country. When asked if her father had ever traveled to the East Coast, my mother explained that he was a traveling salesman. \u201cWe hear that a lot,\u201d the geneticist told her.I was taken aback by how upset I was by this revelation. I had always adored my grandfather, a World War II veteran who devoted himself to volunteer work. Though I knew his marriage to my grandmother was troubled, I didn\u2019t know the extent of it. His betrayal tarnished the memories I had dancing with him at my wedding a few months before he died. It made me regret that I had named my son after him. I was angry at my grandfather for deceiving my mother, as I had been at my father for withholding a sister from me. It was frustrating that we couldn\u2019t get answers from him, as I had been able to with my father.\u201cOnce I saw how overjoyed my mother was to have discovered a sister so late in her life, I forgave him. I came to understand that his past, similar to my father\u2019s, had nothing to do with me. It wasn\u2019t their actions that were reprehensible, but their decisions to hide what happened, that had caused my pain.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nHowever, once I saw how overjoyed my mother was to have discovered a sister so late in her life, I forgave him. I came to understand that his past, similar to my father\u2019s, had nothing to do with me. It wasn\u2019t their actions that were reprehensible, but their decisions to hide what happened, that had caused my pain. I\u2019ve learned an important lesson from the hurt caused by family secrets. My husband and I are as open as we can be with our sons about our personal history. I tell them the truth when they ask me questions about my past. I empathize with my father when I am uncomfortable disclosing previous mistakes. Because of my history, I push past my discomfort and tell them anyway. I\u2019d rather they hear it from me than someone else. As a result, we\u2019re closer. At times I worry that they will judge me, or use the knowledge to justify their own mistakes, but so far that hasn\u2019t happened. Although I think my father made a mistake in hiding his past, I view my relationship with my sister as a blessing, and I know that he feels the same way. The world is a richer place for knowing her, and we\u2019re both grateful. Likewise, my mother and her sister have become quite close and speak often. She has traveled to see her sister and attended her niece\u2019s wedding. Last year, due to COVID, I attended a Zoom baby shower for my cousin instead of in person. It was still fun to be a part of the festivities and watch her open gifts. We continue to be in touch on social media, but it\u2019s not enough. I hope to have the opportunity to travel to meet my new family and create more connections later this year. Enough time has been stolen from me and now its my responsibility to recover what has been lost.

While he\u2019s not yet interested in sex in the erotic sense, he\u2019s extremely interested in understanding the mechanics (and also in telling approximately 7,000 \u201cdeez nuts\u201c jokes a day). This phase has involved answering some of the hardest questions of my parenting career, from \u201cWhat does semen look like?\u201d to \u201cHow do gay people have sex together?\u201dAnd yet, a few weeks ago, when my son told me his 12-year-old friend had shown him something \u201cinappropriate\u201d on \u201cThe Hub,\u201d it didn\u2019t immediately click. He mentioned it a few times, but always amid the frenzied chaos of trying to get out of the house on time to make the bus for camp, or when I was trying to get dinner ready, and it kind of bounced off my harried single-mom brain without making impact.Advertisement\n\nUntil the third or fourth reference, when he finally specified he meant PORNHUB. (He later explained that he calls it \u201cThe Hub\u201d because saying the word porn \u201cmakes him feel uncomfortable inside.\u201d)Apparently, he was on a group chat with said friend and another friend when the older boy screen-shared some clips from the adult site. It took a while for all the details to come out, but it seems he witnessed some, let\u2019s just say aggressive oral sex.\u201cSomeone put the wiener in their mouth!!!\u201d he shout-explained it.I\u2019d been dreading the approach of an age where he would need his own cell phone, partly because it felt like handing him a pocket-sized porn machine. I\u2019m not sure why I felt like porn was any less accessible on the iPad he already has, except that he mostly uses it to play video games and usually while he\u2019s sitting right next to me. I do regular spot checks of what he\u2019s viewing and who he\u2019s talking to, but I\u2019m a single mom who works full-time \u2015 I\u2019d be lying if I said I supervised every second of his device usage.Bottom line: I thought I had time for the porn conversation. Still, at the moment, I knew I wanted to impart a few ideas: 1) You are not in trouble, and curiosity about sex is natural. 2) Porn is for adults and not meant for children, and 3) Porn is not sex education and does not necessarily reflect reality. Advertisement\n\nThe third point was the hardest to explain. When I told him that porn is made by actors who are doing a job, he countered with, \u201cWhat do you mean actors??? The wiener was IN her mouth!!\u201dDeep breath. Yes, the wiener was actually in her mouth. But porn is meant to be entertainment for adults and does not necessarily reflect the reality of sex between two people, I explained. (This led to a conversation about sex work, which I told him was a job like any other job.)I felt pretty good about our off-the-cuff conversation, but in retrospect, porn is something I should have talked to him about before there was potential for him to view it. Afterward, I told Erica Smith, a sexuality educator and consultant, what happened and asked her when parents should start talking to their children about porn. While she says there\u2019s no exact age that these conversations should start, she suggests getting out ahead of the issue and offers up a few guidelines: \u201cBefore puberty. Once you know they have unmonitored access to the internet or devices. If they\u2019re already expressing curiosity about sexuality topics. If they spend time with older kids unsupervised.\u201dSmith directed me to Sex Positive Families, where you can even find scripts for how to broach the topic with children of various ages. Advertisement\n\nAnd look, I\u2019m sure some of you are wondering what tween boy immediately notifies his mom after viewing porn, and I, too, am continually incredulous (but grateful!) that he comes to me with all this stuff. I am sure at some point his teenage sense of privacy is going to kick in, but for now, we are having these incredibly open and honest conversations about sex and sexuality the same way we have them about social injustice, or how to deal with hard feelings. Although I sometimes get a little weary of being notified every time he has an erection, I am glad he feels such a lack of stigma about sex that he is totally comfortable talking to me about it. (For the record, I have told him I don\u2019t really need to know the erection thing.)I don\u2019t believe sex or porn are inherently bad, and treating them as such only drives children into secrecy and shame regarding their inherent curiosity and naturally developing sexuality. \u201cAll the parental controls in the world are not as effective as having a relationship in which your kids know they can come to you with their sex questions.\u201dI was raised evangelical Christian with a heavy emphasis on \u201cpremarital sex = bad,\u201d and partly as a result, I never told anyone when I was assaulted at 14. I was too afraid I\u2019d be in trouble for having sex, even though I hadn\u2019t chosen to. Advertisement\n\nBy treating sex as a neutral topic, I increase the odds that my son will be able to talk to me if he has any kind of sexual problem in the future. As a fifth-grader, he had his first sex education unit this year, but it spanned all of a day, and as far as I know, didn\u2019t cover porn or a lot of other topics I want him to know about like consent and body diversity. By coming to me with his sex questions instead of the internet or his friends, he gets the accurate information he needs to stay safe, and hopefully, grow into a healthy adult sexuality. The casualness with which we discuss sex topics also means that it\u2019s not limited to some big \u201csex talk,\u201d but an ongoing series of talks we are having organically. Like at a restaurant dinner the next week, when he announced, \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about oral sex.\u201d (Lord, help me.)\u201cOK, what questions do you have?\u201d I asked him. So many, it turns out. (Lord, also help any fellow diners who were within earshot of our conversation.)But his questions led to a deeper talk about how porn is often presenting a male fantasy of what sex should be like, and does not always take the woman\u2019s pleasure into account. (Of course, there are women who enjoy all different kinds of sex, but you rarely see a focus in heterosexual porn on, for instance, a woman\u2019s orgasm. Further, plenty of sex acts that consenting adult women might enjoy play out in porn as reality instead of complicated, nuanced fantasy, and aren\u2019t necessarily the acts I want forming my son\u2019s nascent arousal templates.)Advertisement\n\nTo that point, I told him porn serves a purpose and a lot of adults do watch it sometimes, but that I don\u2019t want him learning about sex by watching it now, when he is still developing and forming impressions of what sex may be like. There\u2019s a lot of noise when it comes to how kids are affected by viewing porn, and a lot of bunk \u201cresearch\u201d being presented by religious groups who are also anti-LGBTQ, anti-choice, etc. As Smith points out, no one has actually studied the effects of porn on kids because it would be illegal to show kids pornography. Instead, researchers rely on self-reported experiences from adults. But at least one study found ties between the age of porn viewership and views about sex roles, including wanting power over women. Sex Positive Families also provides a list of ways to help children think critically about sexualized media, including: \u201cPorn does not provide an accurate representation of bodies, sex, consent, or relationships\u201d and \u201dPorn often does not show safer sex practices like condoms, barrier methods, contraception, or discussions between partners about these.\u201d\u201cI get it,\u201d my own little critical thinker told me at the end of our conversation. \u201cIt isn\u2019t real.\u201d Our conversation was a little easier since he hadn\u2019t sought out the porn in the first place, and didn\u2019t particularly want to watch more of it. (Not like my friend\u2019s daughter, whose mom checked her browser history to find out she\u2019d been watching videos of various animals \u201chumping\u201d like it was her job.) My kid has a pretty good sense of what\u2019s not appropriate for him, and a strong inner voice about what makes him uncomfortable, and for now, porn is on that list.I don\u2019t know how long I may have before my kid shuts himself in his bedroom and starts communicating in grunts. But I\u2019ve done my best to let him know he can always come to me with any question or problem, and I will never judge or shame him.Advertisement\n\nAs Smith points out, all the parental controls in the world are not as effective as having a relationship in which your kids know they can come to you with their sex questions. \u201cSometimes parents will install software or limit their kid\u2019s access to the internet in other ways \u2015 this is all up to the individual parent,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the truth is, it\u2019s super easy to access porn no matter what, and the best thing you can do as a parent is keep communication open.\u201dEmily McCombs is the deputy editor of HuffPost Personal.

    "maintext": "In yet another troubling development for Donald Trump\u2019s Truth Social media platform, stock values have taken a dive for the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that Truth Social is supposed to merge with to go public.CNBC reports that prices have fallen 16% this month, including an 8% dip Monday, after investors apparently got jittery about a delay in the planned merger of the SPAC \u2014 Digital World Acquisition Corp. \u2014 with Truth Social\u2019s owner, Trump Media & Technology Group.Advertisement\n\nStocks were trading at $25.32 a share Monday, down significantly from their 2022 peak of about $97, according to CNBC. A Monday filing from Digital World said voting for a yearlong delay in the merger would open Tuesday. The current deadline to take Trump Media public is Sept. 8, but Digital World has warned that it could be forced to liquidate if the deadline is not extended. The company noted in an earlier filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it lost $6.5 million in the first half of the year.The latest development follows news that Truth Social is grappling with other money and trademark issues as Trump deals with various personal legal problems.RightForge, a major web-hosting operator, claimed last week that Truth Social owes some $1.6 million in contractually obligated payments, reported Fox Business.Advertisement\n\n In another setback this month, Truth Social\u2019s application for a trademark was turned down. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office found that Trump\u2019s company name was \u201cconfusingly similar\u201d to other entities. Digital World, already being investigated by the SEC over business dealings, also delayed its earning report earlier this month and warned in a filing last week that a dip in Trump\u2019s popularity could hurt the business.  The Washington Post has reported that Truth Social\u2019s U.S. audience has plunged to about 300,000 views a day, down from nearly 1.5 million when it launched. The site is largely a platform for Trump, with heavy censorship, researchers and critics have found. Detractors say users are better served on competing right-wing social media sites like Telegram, Parler and Gab where there is a greater sense of a developed community with more discussion. Trump has posted a number of messages on Truth Social calling all negative information about his company in the media \u201cfake news.\u201d He has also posted messages asking people to join the site.

This makes her the first woman to have a charting top 10 record in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s, according to Billboard.The impressive feat has only been accomplished by nine other artists \u2014 all of whom are male solo acts or all-male groups. They include AC/DC, Paul McCartney, Def Leppard, Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne, Robert Plant, Prince, James Taylor and Bruce Springsteen. Advertisement\n\nMadonna famously took the music industry by storm with her self-titled debut album, which reached the top 10 in October 1984. All of her later efforts that decade, from \u201cLike a Virgin\u201d and \u201cTrue Blue\u201d to \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d and the \u201cWho\u2019s That Girl\u201d soundtrack, also entered the top 10.The \u201cMaterial Girl\u201d had seven more albums crack that rarified bracket in the 1990s, including \u201cI\u2019m Breathless: Music From and Inspired by the Film Dick Tracy,\u201d \u201cThe Immaculate Collection,\u201d \u201cErotica,\u201d \u201cBedtime Stories,\u201d Something to Remember,\u201d the \u201cEvita\u201d soundtrack and \u201cRay of Light.\u201dShe had six more in the 2000s: \u201cMusic,\u201d \u201cGHV2: Greatest Hits Volume 2,\u201d \u201cAmerican Life,\u201d \u201cConfessions on a Dance Floor,\u201d \u201cHard Candy\u201d and Celebration.\u201d The 2010s saw \u201cSticky & Sweet Tour,\u201d \u201cMDNA,\u201d \u201cRebel Heart\u201d and \u201cMadame X\u201d crack the top 10 charts, as well.Only nine other artists, like Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney, reached this milestone.Clayton Call via Getty ImagesAdvertisement\n\nWhile landing 23 albums in the top 10 charts is a staggering success on its own, nine of them took the No. 1 spot following their release. These included \u201cLike a Virgin,\u201d \u201cTrue Blue,\u201d \u201cLike a Prayer,\u201d \u201cMusic,\u201d \u201cAmerican Life,\u201d \u201cConfessions on a Dance Floor,\u201d \u201cHard Candy\u201d, \u201cMDNA\u201d and \u201cMadame X.\u201dFans might find little new on \u201cFinally Enough Love,\u201d as the compilation largely contains remixes of her old work. The album was practically curated from Billboard\u2019s Dance Club Songs chart, after all, and is composed of Madonna\u2019s 50 No. 1 songs on that list. It nonetheless sold 28,000 copies in its first week and became the first remix album in the Billboard 200 top 10 since Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cMore Only EP\u201d debuted at No. 8 in December 2014. Only Justin Bieber charted higher with a remix album with \u201cNever Say Never\u201d debuting at No. 1 in 2011.

    "maintext": "Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker in \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\"Disney / Lucasfilm via YouTubeDespite what the most unhinged fan with a blank Twitter profile might say, director Rian Johnson stands by \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d as an essential entry in the galaxy-spanning franchise.While certain parts of the fandom, including those who made racist and misogynistic comments about the cast, may have taken issue with the characterization of Jedi master Luke Skywalker and other ways that the film deconstructed existing canon, Johnson said he is \u201ceven more proud\u201d of the film five years after its release.Advertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I was up at bat, I really swung at the ball,\u201d he told Empire magazine in an interview published Tuesday ahead of the blockbuster sequel\u2019s five-year anniversary in December.\u201cI think it\u2019s impossible for any of us to approach Star Wars without thinking about it as a myth that we were raised with, and how that myth, that story, baked itself into us and affected us,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe ultimate intent was not to strip away \u2013 the intent was to get to the basic, fundamental power of myth. And ultimately I hope the film is an affirmation of the power of the myth of Star Wars in our lives.\u201dAs for the movie\u2019s conclusion, which saw Skywalker perish after using every ounce of his energy to save the galaxy once again, Johnson said those final moments were not about \u201cdeconstructing the myth\u201d of the beloved Jedi but \u201cbuilding\u201d it.\u201cThey\u2019re him absolutely defying the notion of, \u2018Throw away the past,\u2019 and embracing what actually matters about his myth and what\u2019s going to inspire the next generation,\u201d the director said. \u201cSo for me, the process of stripping away is always in the interest of getting to something essential that really matters.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nAfter both the critical and commercial success of \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d Johnson was slated to helm his own \u201cStar Wars\u201d trilogy, which has since been indefinitely delayed. Lucasfilm boss Kathleen Kennedy previously cited the filmmaker\u2019s \u201cunbelievably busy\u201d schedule as the reason behind the decision, telling Vanity Fair earlier this year that the studio is \u201cmuch more about persistent storytelling\u201d than trilogies these days.Johnson, who is currently at work on two sequels to his 2019 film \u201cKnives Out,\u201d echoed Kennedy\u2019s sentiments in his comments to Empire, while also reaffirming his commitment to the franchise.\u201cIt\u2019s just at this point a matter of schedule and when it can happen,\u201d he told the magazine, sharing that he\u2019s \u201cstayed close\u201d with Kennedy over the years. \u201cIt would break my heart if I were finished, if I couldn\u2019t get back in that sandbox at some point.\u201dJohnson\u2019s next film, \u201cGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,\u201d arrives on Netflix in December.Related...Warner Bros.

    "maintext": "DjelicS via Getty ImagesThe grass isn't always greener at a new job. Wanting to \"boomerang\" back is normal. If you are unhappy in a new job and secretly wish to return to your old job, you\u2019re not alone. Three out of five U.S. employees who are unhappy after switching jobs during the pandemic said the job they quit was better than their new one, according to a 2022 survey conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of the payroll firm UKG.To be clear, the number of Americans who actually choose to do something about their feelings of discontent and \u201cboomerang\u201d back to their old job is still very small, but growing.Advertisement\n\nA March 2022 analysis of 32 million U.S. LinkedIn members\u2019 job histories found that on average, 4.3% of all U.S. employees switched back to a previous employer in the last year, up from less than 2% in 2010. Boomeranging can boost your career growth.Boomeranging back to an old employer can help some employees get the high-powered job they always wanted by bypassing the steps in a typical internal career trajectory. Margo Kahnrose, chief marketing officer at marketing platform Skai, said boomeranging back to the company after she left it in 2016 gave her time to reflect on the executive role she wanted \u2014 and got. \u201cWhen I returned [to Skai], it was to the same company but not the same job \u2015 rather, it was a chance to expand the impact I could have on the company in a bigger role,\u201d Kahnrose said. \u201cThis was something I couldn\u2019t make happen in a linear path had I stayed, because I didn\u2019t even know at the time I left that I wanted the CMO role. It took a couple of years of looking at things outside-in to clarify for me what relationship I really wanted to have with the company I already loved and respected, and to choose to pursue it.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nKahnrose said it helped that she left on a positive note with relationships intact, and sees boomerangers as a positive asset for a company.\u201cBoomerang employees know \u2015 at least to some extent \u2015 the systems and tools a company uses, the key stakeholders, and the goals of the company,\u201d she said. For some, leaving also helped their employer realize how much they missed their value \u2014 and that helped increase their negotiating leverage as they returned. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many clients of mine have also left their full-time jobs at a company to have their own Great Resignation,\u201d said Nadia De Ala, founder of Real You Leadership, a group coaching program for women of color. \u201cThey simply wanted a break to heal from burnout and have space to think about their next step, and then boomerang later back to their company [as] a contracted employee with more pay, less working hours and much more flexibility to pursue other passions on the side. It\u2019s a brilliant move, and happens more often than people think.\u201dBut having \u2018quitter\u2019s remorse\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you should boomerang.Wanting to boomerang can come from a desire to grow, but it can also stem from hating a new job you thought was going to be better.Advertisement\n\n\u201cPeople I have worked with who regretted a job switch tend to beat themselves up over it, blaming themselves and saying they should have known the new job would not be a good fit,\u201d said Shannon Garcia, a psychotherapist in private practice at States of Wellness Counseling in Illinois and Wisconsin. \u201cThey express feeling \u2018stupid\u2019 and \u2018embarrassed\u2019 about their desire to return to a previous job.\u201dThe need to boomerang can also come from simply needing a job. \u201cI\u2019ve had a client who regretted boomeranging, but went back to their old job because their new employer had a big layoff that unfortunately included them,\u201d De Ala said. \u201cTheir previous employer still hadn\u2019t backfilled their role, and they decided to go right back instead of finding a new job out of necessity. The benefit was that they were able to get a bump in pay and negotiate their boundaries better upon returning.\u201dThe big takeaway should be that feeling a mix of emotions about wanting to boomerang is normal. Even if you totally regret a job switch, it can be a learning moment. De Ala said when her clients have \u201cquitters\u2019 remorse\u201d after taking a new job over staying at an old one, she advises them to practice self-compassion.\u201cI remind them that none of us can see into the future. I remind clients of all the reasons why they were excited for accepting the new offer and moving on to a new company and team,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may feel like a huge mistake and a waste of time, and it\u2019s solvable. You can see if there\u2019s an opportunity to boomerang back or move on to another place that hopefully is more aligned.\u201dNew jobs often come with a steep learning curve that can push us outside our comfort zones. Feeling anxiety in a new situation is normal, Garcia said, and this anxiety shouldn\u2019t be confused for a sign that the job is the wrong fit.Advertisement\n\n\u201cAnxiety will want you to run back to the comfort of your previous job for no other reason than to stop the anxious feelings,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cResist the urge to boomerang in this situation. If this sounds like you, give yourself some time to settle in and expand your comfort zone before deciding a job isn\u2019t for you. There is no growth in the comfort zone.\u201dThink carefully before reapplying for an old job. If you hated the workplace culture at your old job, that is unlikely to change. \u201cIf you left your previous job because you didn\u2019t have chemistry with your team or didn\u2019t align with the company\u2019s values, look elsewhere,\u201d Kahnrose said. \u201cIf you enjoyed the culture and think your experiences working at another company can add value and a fresh mindset to your previous company, then it may make sense to reapply.\u201dRelated...You Could Be 'Quiet Quitting' At Work And Not Even Know ItHow To Make Sure Your Work Is Noticed (Without Being Obnoxious)Research Shows Not Wanting To Hire Virgos Is A Thing That Actually Happens",

    "maintext": "Illustration: Benjamin Currie/HuffPostPeople in abusive situations are running into dangerous roadblocks trying to sever their cell phone number from their abuser's plan.With a flight booked, Caitlin Eckert was ready to leave her abuser. But the morning she was set to go, she remembered they were still on the same phone plan. The two had taken advantage of a deal earlier in their relationship \u2014 two new iPhones \u2014 which put them on a shared plan under his name. Not expecting her relationship to turn abusive (because who would?), this understandably caused her little hesitation at the time.Advertisement\n\nBut now she felt terrified. What if, out of spite, he disconnected and erased her phone number, the one she\u2019d used for 15 years as a young professional, friend and family member?She called customer service and tried to explain her situation calmly. But no matter what she said, the response from the other end was the same: Her abuser would have to make the call or show up to the store to take her off the plan.\u201cAt one point, I broke down and asked the stranger on the other line, \u2018What do I do?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWhich, looking back, I realize was both in terms of the cell phone plan and the abuse I was experiencing.\u201dUnwilling to accept the options provided, Eckert went to the store in person. Her flight was in a few hours, but she knew this needed to be squared away. Advertisement\n\nAt the store, three men greeted her. They asked if she was the main account holder; she said she wasn\u2019t. \u201cImmediately, they threw their hands up and told me that there was nothing they could do,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember feeling an immediate wave of defeat rush over me, as I knew that in order to emancipate myself from my abuser, I would need his active participation in the process.\u201dThis is a far-reaching issue.Are all phone companies like this? The short answer: It depends. \u201cCell phone providers have different laws and regulations dependent on the state,\u201d said Blair Dorosh-Walther, program manager of economic empowerment at Safe Horizon, a victim assistance organization. \u201cUnfortunately, most states do not have supportive domestic violence protections.\u201d Many others have confronted this predicament. In one Twitter thread, people talked about facing or learning about this issue with Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, the country\u2019s three biggest carriers. The hoops to jump through are never-ending, even for survivors who are able to go through the process required by their carrier. I found out today that if you have @Verizon wireless, you have to get consent from the account owner to leave the plan. This puts victims of intimate partner violence in a bind at best, and at risk of violence at worse. @verizon: fix this.\u2014 Ashleyja (@therapy_mamma) February 4, 2022\n\nA Verizon Support representative replied to the Twitter thread, saying \u201cI assure you that any domestic violence victim that receives an order from a court to assume responsibility of their wireless number, can do so without requiring authorization from the current account owner or manager.\u201d Advertisement\n\nIn response to questions from HuffPost, the company claimed, \u201cWe work very closely with survivors to make sure they can get any documentation we request, and we make sure we don\u2019t put anyone at risk.\u201dT-Mobile said, in part, \u201cT-Mobile supports the Safe Connections Act that would make [being able to sever a phone line without the consent of an abuser] a consistent federal policy. We also support domestic violence survivors where they need assistance with device ownership and service costs.\u201d Neither carrier said policies requiring survivors to produce court orders or other documentation have been eliminated, and AT&T did not answer questions about their policies. But going to court, let alone getting a court order, is incredibly hard and a major barrier for survivors. The time, money, evidence and resources needed can simply be too much, making laws that are supposedly \u201chelpful\u201d far from it.\u201cOften, laws supporting domestic violence survivors end up creating far more work for the survivor than the person causing harm, which may be additionally traumatizing,\u201d Dorosh-Walther added. \u201cCell phone contracts are no different.\u201d As you can imagine, this situation ensures survivors are even more controlled by their abusers, and in multiple ways. \u201c[It] allows the account owner to access and control to not only the call log, text exchanges, etc., but also the victim\u2019s \u2018numeric identity,\u2019 as many friends and family members likely know how to contact this person primarily via phone,\u201d said Rahkim Sabree, an author who specializes in financial abuse and financial trauma. \u201cIf access to the phone is lost, many of the apps that rely on two-factor authorization will lock you out because you can\u2019t access texts, emails, etc., without your phone, including bank accounts and social media, which deepens the degree to which the victim can be controlled.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nPlus, the legal definition of abuse doesn\u2019t cover certain forms of emotional abuse, for example, that are just as serious.Some states are making changes, but it\u2019s only a start. \u201cConnecticut recently passed Jennifer\u2019s Law that now includes coercive control \u2026 as a form of domestic violence,\u201d said Cristina Perera, a licensed marriage and family therapist at Thriveworks in New Haven, Connecticut, who specializes in abuse and trauma. \u201cCurrently, this law is only in Connecticut and California.\u201dGetting out of a family plan with an abuser is difficult, but not impossible.So what can be done?Let\u2019s start with what\u2019s currently happening in terms of legislation. In July, the House of Representatives passed The Safe Connections Act, after a companion bill had already been passed in the Senate. It gives survivors the ability to remove themselves from a family phone plan without problems or fees, but has yet to be made law. So what can someone in this situation do in the meantime? First and foremost, safety planning. \u201cSafety planning is essential, not only for contract bifurcation, but [for] any step a survivor takes away from the person causing them harm towards physical and financial safety,\u201d Dorosh-Walther said.Creating this plan with someone at a domestic violence center or hotline, such as the National Domestic Violence Hotline, is your best bet. Otherwise, worksheets like this one can help. Advertisement\n\nSide note: If you don\u2019t feel comfortable having the hotline in your call list at all, see if a friend can do the calling for you, or let you call from their phone. Know that the number will not appear on your bill. \u201cShelters and hotline numbers for those seeking help are blocked from appearing on records, so people can make contact without fear of being found out,\u201d Perera said.Once that\u2019s squared away, here are some options to consider if your phone provider won\u2019t make exceptions for safety.Document the abuse.As a survivor and licensed clinical social worker, Eckert recommended \u201cdocumenting stalking, tracking, accessing your private and personal information, threats to cut off your phone, accessing private photos and other means of abuse through the cell phone plan.\u201d As much as you\u2019re able to, take screenshots, gather medical documents, videos and notes \u2014 and of all the abuse, not just the technological stuff. This can help with obtaining court orders and, hopefully, dealing with your cell phone provider.Talk to your abuser about getting off the plan ASAP.\u201cIf I had known this would have been so difficult to get out of, I would have started the process of convincing my abuser to let me off the plan for months,\u201d Eckert added. (After an incredible amount of convincing and compromise, she got her abuser to agree.)Advertisement\n\nIf you can\u2019t leave yet, but are planning to leave later, you can also consider more indirect ways of talking to your abuser. Maybe you can make an excuse about wanting a different phone or carrier, see if you can become the new account holder, say you want separate plans, or not give a reason at all. Again, talking through your options with someone on a domestic violence hotline first is ideal.File for a domestic violence restraining order, or DVRO.This requires filling out some forms. In California, for example, that could start with the state\u2019s DV-100 form to request a long-term domestic violence restraining order \u2014 but there\u2019s a faster option available, too. \u201cWhile DV-100 is a request for a restraining order on a long-term basis, the DV-110 allows you to get a temporary restraining order quickly before your scheduled DVRO hearing is set, which can be a few months out from the date of your filing,\u201d said Rita Mkrtchyan, a senior attorney at Oak View Law Group. She added that in California, the DV-110 will probably be signed by a judge within a few days of filing and can help you get a court order. Check the process in your state to see what your options are.You may not be able to wait a few days to sever your phone line, though. If that\u2019s the case, Mkrtchyan suggested submitting your filed documents to the phone carrier, even before a judge signs off on them. \u201cSome carriers will accept this as enough evidence to leave the phone plan without permission from the account holder. This may take some persuading, however,\u201d she said.Advertisement\n\n                  It\u2019s helpful to have a plan in place before you file for a restraining order \u2014 though a restraining order is meant to reduce your risk, some studies and surveys show there\u2019s a chance an abuser may retaliate and break a restraining order after being served.                  See if your state has a law about phone plans and domestic violence.Look into (or ask a loved one to look into) the laws regarding phone plans and domestic violence in your state. \u201cIn recent years, many states have passed laws allowing a judge to issue a court order directly to the phone company, as part of a protection order case, to order changes to the shared plan that is in the abuser\u2019s name,\u201d said Deborah J. Vagins, president and CEO of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. She explained that this order transfers the billing to the survivor\u2019s name and allows the survivor (and any children) to carry their phone numbers to a different plan. The NNEDV\u2019s WomensLaw.org website has a helpful section on that, she added.Vagins noted that \u201cin the states where it\u2019s authorized, [a court order to leave a shared plan] is often requested as part of the protection order process. Some states require the possibility of imminent danger before a protection order is granted, and proving that may be challenging.\u201d Advertisement\n\nWhile not for everyone, and sometimes difficult to access or afford, protection orders can be good for some survivors. \u201cBy no means do I want to discourage victims from filing for a protection order and making this wireless transfer request,\u201d Vagins said. \u201cProtection orders can be a crucial part of a safety plan for many victims.\u201d Get a new phone number.If you can give up on your phone and phone number, starting over with a new one may be the route to take. Perera said that shelters can direct survivors who choose this path to specific agencies that can provide free or affordable plans. This is what survivor, advocate and resilience expert Jamie Wright had to do when her abuser wouldn\u2019t help. It was a choice she didn\u2019t want to have to make, but she\u2019s been able to find silver linings. \u201cMy therapist helped me reframe the loss of my phone number (which I honestly felt, at the time, my phone number was part of my identity, who I was),\u201d she said. \u201cShe also helped me process and reframe the loss of some of my contacts as a way to clear space in my new life for new relationships [and] connections that aligned with my new life, the life I was beginning to embark on, free from violence.\u201d While this option may be the best one for some people, it\u2019s okay to still be upset if you have to go this route. It will cause extra hassle, like having to email or message your new number to clients, co-workers, family and friends, but it may be worth it in the end. Advertisement\n\nGetting off of your abuser\u2019s phone plan is harder than it should be \u2014 there\u2019s no doubt about that. But please know you have people in your corner who want to help. You have a way out, and you deserve to feel safe.For more resources for survivors navigating technological safety, check out TechSafety.org and the NNEDV\u2019s technology safety page.Need help?

    "maintext": "Axelle/Bauer-Griffin via Getty ImagesIf Jennifer Lopez did use astrology to make hiring decisions, she won't be the only one. Many professionals believe it can give career insights.Can your astrology sign cost you a job? \u201cGlee\u201d actor and former Beyonc\u00e9 backup dancer Heather Morris claimed this week that Jennifer Lopez once refused to hire backup dancers who were Virgos.While Lopez was auditioning dancers for one of her tours at the time, Morris claimed during a recent appearance on the podcast \u201cJust Sayin\u2019 With Justin Martindale,\u201d that Lopez asked prospective dancers an unexpected question.Advertisement\n\n\u201cThank you so much, you guys have worked so hard. By a show of hands, if there are any Virgos in the room, can you just raise your hand?\u201d Morris claimed Lopez told dancers after a long day.         View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Justin Martindale (@justinmartindale)\nMorris alleged Lopez noted which dancers raised their hands and whispered to her assistant. The Virgos were reportedly dismissed. \u201cThey had to leave after a full day of auditioning for Jennifer Lopez,\u201d Morris said. When Martindale asked whether the story was true, Morris admitted she heard it from multiple people but the anecdote was just \u201chearsay.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nLopez has yet to comment on the story. While Morris\u2019 account of Lopez dismissing Virgo dancers is unproved, a significant number of people do believe that a person\u2019s astrological sign can tell them something about whether that person will be a good employee.Using a Zodiac sign to make hiring decisions is biased and wrong, but it happens. (Heads up, Cancers!)A 2020 study found that participants in China, including one group made up of human resources professionals, were less willing to hire job candidates whose re\u0301sume\u0301s explicitly stated that they were a Virgo because of perceived disagreeable traits. The study was published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, with a research team including Jackson Lu, an associate professor of work and organization studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management.In China, \u201csome people intentionally avoid Virgos (those born between August 23 and September 22) as friends, romantic partners, or employees, purportedly because Virgos (literally translated as \u2018virgin\u2019 in Chinese) are stereotyped as having disagreeable personalities (e.g., critical, fussy, picky, obsessive-compulsive, germophobic),\u201d the study authors explained. When the research team did a comparative study on astrological stereotypes with U.S. participants, they found that, overall, Americans were less likely than their Chinese counterparts to agree that knowing someone\u2019s astrological sign helped to understand them. Advertisement\n\nThere was no consensus on the worst astrological sign among the American participants, but Cancers were viewed negatively by the largest group of people. \u201cThe largest percentage of American participants selected Cancer as the most negatively evaluated sign in American society, possibly because of its semantic association with the disease cancer,\u201d the authors stated in the study. Signs are fun to talk about, but people shouldn\u2019t be labeled because of it.One reason why irrational astrological stereotypes may persist? They\u2019re fun to talk about. They can function as \u201csocial lubricants in social communication,\u201d the study\u2019s authors noted. \u201cSome individuals irrationally resort to astrological signs and stereotypes as cognitive shortcuts to help them make sense of complex social reality,\u201d Lu told HuffPost. \u201cThe danger is that, as shown in our large-scale studies, astrological signs do not predict personality or job performance.\u201dOne of Lu\u2019s studies examined the performance scores and birthdates of 37,878 employees at one Chinese conglomerate and found that a person\u2019s sign did not predict whether they performed well as an employee. Advertisement\n\nIt\u2019s clear that, even though astrological signs are meaningless tools for evaluating whether someone can do a job well, they are still a popular conversation starter and a career guide. Indeed, some American professionals say they consult astrology before making a big career move.Mary Abbajay, president of leadership development consultancy at Careerstone Group (and a Gemini), said she believes astrology can tell you something about who you are as a professional.\u201cAnything that can give you some insight into how you operate, how you think, how you behave can be helpful,\u201d she said. \u201cI learned that one of the things that drive my team crazy is that I can always see both sides. According to my husband, the fake astrologer, it\u2019s because I have a Libra moon. Libras can always see both sides of an argument.\u201d Abbajay said she has talked about astrology with her team as a fun get-to-know-you exercise and sees the insights similar to those someone might get from a well-known personality test.\u201cI would never, ever use it to determine whether I was going to hire somebody or not,\u201d she added. Abbajay cautioned that if professionals do want to chat astrology with their colleagues, they shouldn\u2019t pressure anyone into it or label someone\u2019s personality as a result.Advertisement\n\n\u201cLay off using it as an assessment tool for people, because people are complex, and you are much more than whatever your astrological sign is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun until someone gets fired.\u201d As for Lu, he comes down firmly on the side that astrology should not have any decision-making power at work. \u201cAstrology is not scientific,\u201d he said, \u201cand thus should not be used to make decisions in a workplace.\u201dRelated...Meet The People Who Make Major Career Decisions Based On AstrologyWhat If You Just Paid Off (Or Paid Down) Your Federal Student Loans?You Could Be 'Quiet Quitting' At Work And Not Even Know It",

I was a little concerned before I got it because I wasn't sure how accurate it would be. When I used it when I went on vacation, it was dead on to what the airport said, so I highly recommend this. Plus, it\u2019s easy to pack in your bags.\" \u2014 Teresa Daniels$10.99+ at Amazon13www.amazon.comAnd a lightweight raincoatAvailable in women's sizes XS\u20133X and 29 colors.Promising review: \"This Columbia windbreaker is perfect for me. I wore it as a top layer on a trip to Iceland. It couldn't have performed better. Waterproof enough to suit my needs during rainy weather (but not necessarily a downpour). Deep, zipper pockets are a bonus. I wear it spring thru autumn in Wisconsin, plus it is a staple when I travel; packs small and light. My only complaint is velcro closings are not my favorite, but that's just personal preference. I ordered a size larger than my usual to provide for plenty of layering room.\" \u2014 C. Baltus$39.99+ at Amazon14B\u00e9isA genius backpackB\u00e9is is a woman-owned travel accessories brand founded by actress and entrepreneur Shay Mitchell. You'll find carry-on rollers, weekender bags, packing cubes, and more practical goods for your next trip! Also available in black.BuzzFeed editor Chelsea Stuart owns this backpack and said: \"I just bought this bag for a five-day cross-country road trip and it came in so clutch. First, I flew with it and was able to stow it under my seat so not only did I not have to check a bag, but I didn't even have to deal with overhead storage. Then, it traveled through 10+ states and various hotels with me. My absolute favorite parts of the bag are the compression straps and the fact that it fully unzips. This makes it *SO* easy to pack, unpack, and take through airport security. I was able to fit ~four pairs of leggings, four T-shirts, two sets of pajamas, two pairs of shorts, two bathing suits, a sweatshirt, a week's worth of undergarments, travel toiletries, an iPad, my wallet, and more odds and ends.\"$78 at Beis15www.amazon.comOr a nylon anti-theft backpackAvailable in two sizes and 12 colors.Promising review: \"A must-have for traveling! This backpack is lightweight, has multiple pockets on the inside and outside for small items, and was so awesome for an eight-day vacation to Hawaii! Felt safe with my items in it and it was a great small personal item on the plane. Highly recommend!\" \u2014 Marianne :]$25.99+ at Amazon16www.amazon.comA Tide To-Go stain removing penPromising review: \"These were a lifesaver. I was walking to the bus and decided it was a great decision to drink coffee while walking. Like a scene from an infomercial, I spilled coffee all over my white shirt. Yes, the classic coffee on the white shirt. Luckily I had one of these in my bag (I put one in each of my most-used purses in anticipation of my clumsiness). I went into a store bathroom and quickly scrubbed the Tide To-Go on my shirt. All of the coffee blobs went away and once the awkward wet splotches dried up, my shirt was perfectly white again. You've got yourself a big fan, Tide.\" \u2014 NAD$7.35 at Amazon17www.amazon.comA Bluetooth-enabled maskAvailable in four colors.Promising review: \"After a bout of pandemic-induced insomnia I picked up one of these USB-chargeable masks and can honestly say it was LIFE-changing. If you're sensitive to light or sound, this mask is where it's at. The contoured, cool-to-the-touch eye pads are super cozy and extra padding on the bridge of the nose ensures no light seeps in. I was concerned about feeling the headphones through the mask and not being able to sleep in my usual position (mountain climber, the hands-down comfiest position), but they really are unnoticeable. I can sleep through the night with it on and the Velcro straps have never once gotten stuck in my hair. The battery also lasts for a full 10 hours, so I don't have to worry about my audio going out right as I'm dozing off.\" \u2014Chelsea Stuart$22.59+ at Amazon18AmazonA TSA-approved toiletry carry-onAvailable in 11 colors.Promising review: \"This thing truly packs a punch. I could fit everything I needed for an overnight hotel stay plus seven-day cruise to the Caribbean. Passed through TSA checkpoints without any problem, too. The sturdy build and tough zipper make this a quality toiletry pouch. Very happy with my purchase!\" \u2014 Orange Blossom$13.99 at Amazon19www.amazon.comAnd a hanging toiletry bagAvailable in six colors.Promising review: \"Seriously?! Do you see how much this holds?! Full shampoo bottles, face washes, hair brush...everything I could need or want to bring, FITS IN THIS ONE BAG! And it\u2019s so cute! Feels like great quality too \u2014 all the hardware came with protective wraps to keep from scratching and the zippers feel very hardy. The hook at the top is also VERY WELL SECURED to the bag, it\u2019s double stitched to the top panel, and almost feels like seatbelt material. And I love the extra pockets and netting inside. I would absolutely recommend this!\" \u2014 mahea_c$25.99 at Amazon20ECO Paradise Goods / EtsyA portable cutlery set for meals on the goEco Paradise Goods is a small business based in Florida that sells cute eco-friendly goods, including reusable grocery bags and silicone straws.

I still prefer tangible books but I have to say I'm in love with this device. I find myself reaching for the Kindle more than my books just for the ease of use, built in light and font enlargement features. A quick tutorial on YouTube had me up to speed with all the other awesome options. Highly recommend this especially if you are a frequent traveler. No more lugging around several heavy books in your carry-on! The only negative is photos come over in black & white but it's not a deal-breaker for the convenience it offers!\" \u2014 radiogirl85$139.99+ at Amazon22AmazonA set of packing cubesThis set comes with an extra large cube, large cube, medium cube, small cube, roomy shoe bag, and a laundry bag for dirty clothes! Available in 10 colors.Promising review: \"I was traveling for 14 days and dreaded how the neatly packed suitcase usually became the suitcase from hell after a couple of days of travel. These bags were wonderful! I rolled my clothing and had very little wrinkling. I divided the bags into pants, tops, undies and shoes. We were usually in the city but had plans for a rafting trip as well. I put all my rafting clothing and supplies into another bag. It also came with a laundry bag, which was very handy. It was so easy to move from hotel to hotel because my bag was always neat and orderly. I am thinking of buying more to organize my chest of drawers at home.\" \u2014 Amazon customer$28.99 at Amazon23Jasmin Sandal / BuzzFeedOr vacuum seal bags\"I swear by these bad boys not only for general storage purposes, but also if I know I'm going to be traveling for an extended period of time. As someone who tends to pack for every eventuality (who doesn't like to be prepared?!), I have learned that it's better to travel with them than without \u2014 especially since it's more or less a guarantee that my clothes are gonna take up a ~substantial~ amount of room in my suitcase. And if I can use something that's gonna shrink the size of my bulky hoodies and/or big tees in order for me to create more space, I'm sure as heck gonna do it. Plus, the satisfaction is indeed guaranteed because when you see those chunky layers flatten into a pancake... it's just chef's kiss.\" \u2014 Jasmine Sandal$18.99 at Amazon24www.amazon.comA portable door lockPromising review: \"My apartment door has a deadbolt but no lock on the door handle. The latch is also misplaced so if it\u2019s not dead bolted anyone can just push my door open. Took a few tries to get this right but makes me feel much more secure and it\u2019s easy to use when you get the hang of it! I also take this with me when traveling as it fits almost all doors. Definitely recommend.\" \u2014 Anna$14.99 at Amazon25AmazonA buckled luggage strapAvailable in six colors.Promising review: \"I love this little gadget. I used it to attach my jacket and computer bag to my luggage on an extended business trip. It made my airport walks so much easier.

I honestly am in love! I got the Heali Kiwi shampoo bar and the Wonderbar conditioner, as well as one of their eco-friendly bamboo and sugar cane storage containers, and my very long, fine oily hair, which I do have to wash daily looks and feels great. I recommend anyone on the fence to definitely give it a try! It works! So wonderful for travel too!\" \u2014 M.A.$15.99 at Amazon27AmazonA BPA-free collapsible water bottleAvailable in six colors.Promising review: \"This bottle rolled up and stored perfectly until I was through security, then I filled it (instead of paying $5 for a bottle of water at airport) and carried it. Once on the plane, I simply tucked it into the seat pocket in front of me. I loved it. I say 'loved' because they asked for volunteers to leave the plane, as it was overcrowded \u2014 or too much weight, as a captain put it \u2014 so I offered to wait till next flight. Unfortunately, I left my bottle tucked in the seat pocket \ud83d\ude23.

I've been able to fit everything I need for a weeklong trip into this with room to spare. It has two main compartments: one side with an interior compression system so you can pack all your soft clothes, and then a zippered side for all of your loose items. It also comes with a laundry bag for you to store all your dirty clothes as you travel. I like how durable it is \u2014 I've definitely knocked it against the wall or a bench a few times and I haven't gotten a scratch or a dent on it. And even if I do end up damaging it, Away has a limited lifetime warranty on their suitcases that covers any functional damage to the shell, wheels, handles, zippers, or anything else that impairs your use of the luggage. This is definitely a splurge-worthy purchase I feel like I got my money's worth out of (and then some!).\" \u2014 Ciera Velarde $275+ at Away30www.amazon.comA mini lightweight flat ironIt also comes with a heat-resistant pouch for easy carrying!Promising review: \"I got this nice little and compact hair straightener for my trip to the beach. It is small and lightweight. Perfect for a trip. It heats up really fast, with in seconds it is very hot. It comes with a pouch to tuck it away in. You do need to move slowly through your hair because the heated part is small but it does a good job. I made a little video to show how nice it is. Also I like the comfort of the design to hold it. Fits nicely in my hand. Not heavy like the bigger bulkier ones are. I took my time and shopped around for a travel one. I think this will be good to use every day. It doesn\u2019t take up much space either.\" \u2014 Connie Cunningham$17.97 at Amazon31Fragole & CoAnd a distinguishable 3D acrylic luggage tagFragola & Co. is a small Etsy shop that sells bright customized accessories, including key chains and luggage tags.

While no one necessarily expects their car battery to tap out on them, it\u2019s always a possibility.

Advertisement\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a service like AAA on standby or don\u2019t feel like waiting for an unknown amount of time for someone to come rescue you, having a handheld gadget that can get the job done is a lifesaver. The rechargeable Halo portable car jump starter is the perfect have in your car at all times. Not only can it revive a full-sized car or SUV with the included mini jumper cables, but it also has a bright built-in floodlight in case you\u2019re stuck at night on a dark road, plus additional USB ports to charge your other electronics. $94.66+ at AmazonThe Halo comes in multiple colors, including rose gold, navy blue, mint green, black, camo, silver and gold marble.

I never heard of it before but my dad has one. My car was totally dead. It had been sitting for three months and it started right up after using the Halo. I bought myself one and had to use it twice already. It\u2019s good for three car charges before you have to recharge the Halo. I never jumped a car before and I was able to figure this out all by myself.\u201d \u2014 kim philanthropichr \u201cI bought this to keep in my Corolla while traveling alone. I didn\u2019t want to have to rely on strangers if I needed a jump, or to be stranded hours from home. I charged it and left it in the car. Even in cold Temps, it has held its charge over the past couple of months. I tried it for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised at how powerful it is. I was able to quickly and easily jump my husband\u2019s work truck- a newer F250 truck with a 6.2 engine. Definitely worth the money, I\u2019m impressed and will probably buy another for hubby as well!\u201d \u2014 Jen \u201cThis has come in handy so may times that I bought one for everyone in the house. Almost right after getting it, my daughter used it at school because her friends car needed a jump start. It is so worth the money. We have AAA, but why wait?!?!?!?!

I didn't know how gross our Keurig was until today. The big mason jar on the left is when I actually ran the cleaner through plus one rinse cycle.

I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and dishes just not getting clean. Then, I became aware that the water softener was no longer doing its job so I had the rental company replace it. Dishwasher performance improved somewhat. I decided to do two more loads before deciding to purchase a new one. Then I saw a product test review for Affresh. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway so I added that to my order. When it came, I tossed one of the tablets into the bottom of the full machine per the instructions and ran the regular cycle. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I will use this faithfully every month, as recommended. I can even put it on my subscribe and save order so I will get a new pack every six months.

I was really frustrated until I found these. They work amazingly well. They're small, so if the area was larger I had to use two or three, but they pulled up stains and saved the house from being smelly. I even used one on an older stain (that I'm pretty sure wasn't pet related) and it came up after leaving it on for about 24 hours.

Also, it works with JUST water!Promising review: \"I had had it with my broken basic mop and bucket. I tried to just get a dollar store Swiffer to get us by, but that wasn't cutting it at all. With three boys and a dog who makes his rounds on all the furniture and every exposed corner, I had to do something. After seeing a TikTok where a woman demonstrated this mop to clean her walls, and hearing my boss raving about it, I decided to click the Amazon button. Let me tell you, I HATE cleaning, I HATE mopping, but I LOVE for things to be clean. I was able to mop the entire house TWICE (Because it was that dirty. Please don't judge.) within an hour. A few days later I mopped the entire house again within 10 minutes because they weren't quite as dirty. On another positive note, my boys love the spinner and think it\u2019s a toy! So, every time I get the bucket out my 10-year-old and 4-year-old ask to mop the house because they think it\u2019s fun. MAJOR BONUS!\" \u2014 Molly$32.99 at Amazon12AmazonA reusable roller dog hair removerPromising review: \"I have a golden retriever and the shedding is out of control. My fabric sofa is constantly covered in hair and I finally decided to try this after reading an article about popular TikTok products. The reviews do not lie, this thing works magic!! I wish I had taken a before and after picture because the difference is noticeable. I watched the video tutorial before I tried it to ensure I was using it properly and everything he says is true, you do really have to put your arm to work with vigorous back and forth movement!

This is nontoxic and should be nonirritating on the skin!Promising review: \"I had terrible rust and oil stains all over the seats of my car when I bought it. I tried other cleaners to get it out, but they actually made the stains darker. I took it to the dealership to see if they could get it out and they flat out told me no, so I gave up and lived with it for almost five years. I tried this after it was recommended by a friend. I sprayed it on and literally watched the stain run right off my seat. It was amazing! I thought I was going to have to pay hundreds of dollars to replace the seats in my car because nothing else would work. This stuff really is awesome!\" \u2014 Brittany $12.85 at Amazon14www.amazon.comGreen Gobbler clog dissolverMy bathroom sink tends to stop up far too easily and this does a drastically better job of clearing the gunk than Drano or Liquid Plumbr. I also love that it's noncorrosive (I live in a pre-war apartment building with old pipes) and odorless (no one loves feeling like a bug being fumigated in their own home)! Promising review: \"OK... So I have to do a little review on this product BECAUSE I have had a stopped-up kitchen sink and have LITERALLY tried EVERYTHING down to the industrial products with NO luck. I decided to go on Amazon and read a few reviews. This is the one I decided to go with. I only used one chamber, let it sit for an hour, and then used boiling water.

Promising review: \"Incredible product! Go buy this now! I bought the product as a test drive to find ways to 'go green' in our household and was so pleasantly surprised! These are super tough on dishes and countertops but also so easy to wring out and keep using again! The hardest part is breaking the habit of reaching for a disposable paper towels but these are a new staple for us and I'm sure we will buy even more as we learn to use this instead of disposable ones!

I like that this is black so it matches the original color of the appliances, but more importantly I like that this has a larger surface area to catch the drips that the foil ones never could before. They're also trim to fit, so they get right up into each burner without leaving gaps where drips can burn where it's hardest to clean. Time will tell if they're as durable/reusable as they claim. If they are, then I'll try to trim two of the spares to fit the center large burner.

    "maintext": "Tears welled in Janel Bell\u2019s eyes as she thought back on her struggle to make sense of her purpose. \u201cThis brings back a lot that I hadn\u2019t really thought about in a long time, that isolation. I\u2019ve always been a think-on-my- own, I don\u2019t follow the crowd type \u2026 I\u2019m pretty much self-made,\u201d she says, reflecting on her search for someone to guide her professionally. \u201cIt can be very isolating when you don\u2019t have anyone else as like-minded to really connect with.\u201d After 25 years of raising children, the 47-year-old mother of 10 thought that there was absolutely no one who could relate to her experience, let alone help her craft a new career trajectory. With a little intentional intervention, though, Bell realized that the next chapters of her professional dreams were yet to be written.Initially, Bell was reluctant to apply to Unlock Her Potential, a nonprofit mentorship program she came across, because she struggled seeing her worth beyond motherhood. But the universe quickly and joyfully shattered that fallacy. It soon became evident that her unique experience with caregiving was one that she knew people could learn from. She toyed with the idea of writing a book, but had no idea where or how to start. The mentor she was matched with, Marcelle Karp, is an author and creative director, and was able to tap into a part of her that had been overlooked. \u201cThrough her, I would not be where I am now, It was just such an awesome experience to have her unlock the writer within me,\u201d Bell tells me.I am no stranger to the loneliness of navigating professional spaces. During my college years, I learned that mentorship was not just integral to a successful career path, but also integral to our confidence in a given field. I learned that mentors provide mentees with early stage developmental opportunities, speak their names in rooms they haven\u2019t entered, and help them realize their full potential \u2015 but finding a good one was a brutal task. Advertisement\n\nWhile I spent hundreds of hours grooming myself for the moment when someone would swoop in and help me make sense of what it was I was trying to do with my life, the coffee dates and emails selling myself to individuals I thought I\u2019d bond with felt awkward and ineffective. I lost hope in mentorship all together. It felt like another thing that wasn\u2019t for me, only deepening the pre-existing loneliness. While this experience did force me to grow a thick skin and become self-sufficient, this was only scar tissue on the deep wound left behind by the struggle of being denied something we all need \u2014 a reliable guiding light with the wisdom to propel us forward.Sophia Chang with mentors and mentees.Johnny NunezWomen of color, in particular, struggle to find mentorship in all industries. And we need them badly. We are passed up for opportunities to work under and learn from gatekeepers, even when we have all of the credentials and experience to do so. The lack of these connections are reflected in ongoing data about how undervalued we are: Women of color representing only 4% of C-suite employees, for example, and reportedly earn far less than their white male counterparts. Bias isn\u2019t something that we can change overnight, but having the tools to shatter glass ceilings will at least start the process.Black and brown women should not be left to tread the choppy waters of our careers alone. And frankly, effective mentorship looks different for us than it does for Chad in accounting. We need access to all of the insider secrets that propel our white counterparts to promotions and raises. For this reason, screenwriter and author Sophia Chang, founded Unlock Her Potential in 2020, to address the lack of mentorship amongst women of color ages 18 and up. Advertisement\n\n\u201cOur goal is to see more of us ascend to positions of power that grant us the leverage of making decisions that will impact our community. We want more of us in the C-suites calling shots,\u201d says Chang. Chang experienced the power of professional guidance after building a relationship with her mentor Michael Ostin, former president of A&R at Warner Brothers Records and former President of Dreamworks Records, whom she met in the late \u201980s during the budding stages of her career. It was through this relationship that she was able to actualize her own path. \u201cMentorship is deeply meaningful to success because it helps us shape our thoughts around our identity, value and direction,\u201d says Chang. Along with providing her with a deeper understanding of herself, her mentor was able to present opportunities that she might not have had otherwise.It was important for Chang to build a program that included male mentors so they could share some of the privilege they experience just by existing in a professional space. \u201cI think for white men, mentorship comes about organically because most industries are built by, populated by, and sustained for them. Therefore, they\u2019re naturally welcomed into the rooms and integrated into the conversations. It\u2019s more difficult for women of color because we are not the default, like whiteness is,\u201d Chang said. She\u2019s not wrong.Throughout industries, women of color often struggle with demystifying what is often referred to as \u201cthe process\u201d because of a difference in cultural norms and language. This ultimately makes it difficult to connect with individuals who might be able to guide them, Chang tells me. In the program, she pairs women with established individuals (our team found out about the program because HuffPost\u2019s editor-in-chief, Danielle Belton, volunteers as a mentor) who can help decode the rules, while also providing invaluable advice to bright and capable, yet overlooked, talent. Advertisement\n\nAnd the program bears more tangible fruits as well. \u201cThough Unlock Her Potential is about guidance and not access, we have had remarkable scenarios where mentors have extended themselves to make introductions, write letters of recommendation, even hire their mentees.\u201dMichelle Malizaki, a 53-year-old stand-up comedian, is one of 300 women who have been mentored in the program so far. She immigrated to California from Japan to attend San Diego State where she hoped to major in theater, but was discouraged when a professor told her she was a good actor as long as she didn\u2019t speak. Yeah, you read that right.\u201cI\u2019ve tried to get scholarships, and things like that, anything that would help me better. I\u2019m usually considered, but I\u2019m never picked, and that\u2019s been my whole life \u2026 I\u2019m good enough, but I\u2019m not great enough,\u201d said Milizaki. After college she wanted to be a copywriter but spent a large portion of her early career meandering through corporate doing TV production work. Malizaki recalls working on reality TV, variety shows, documentaries and sports news before getting married and deciding to become a stay-at-home mom. Cara Kim, Unlock Her Potential volunteer and website designer; Jordan Caldwell, Unlock Her Potential managing director; volunteer Wedad Jaber.Johnny NunezAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I was 45-ish, I was like, is this how things are going to end for me? I\u2019m not doing anything for society. I\u2019m not happy. What am I doing? What am I living for?\u201d said Milizaki. What she calls a mid-life crisis led her to improv classes, open-mics, and then stand-up comedy, which she had no idea was an actual profession until five years ago. After applying to UnLock Her Potential, she was paired with comedic giant Russell Peters, who was one of the comics she discovered during her early days binging stand-up on XM radio\u2019s Laugh USA. During her initial interactions, she spent a lot of time doubting herself until Peters let her know he had hand-picked her application. This moment changed the perception she had of herself moving forward. \u201cI had no words, it really boosted my self-confidence,\u201d said Milizaki. During their mentorship period, she had the opportunity to open up for Peters for two shows, while also receiving his advice which was always imbued with kindness. \u201cI was cautious in the beginning because of what I\u2019ve been through. I\u2019m not looking for a friend, I\u2019m looking for a north star to guide me \u2015 Russell is a high north star for me, I have aways to go, but he\u2019s been that,\u201d she added.Many of us have learned to adapt to being constantly dismissed or disrespected in our fields. We continue to stride, steering our professional journeys and advocating for our needs at a pace all our own, but at any age \u2014 we benefit from a little nudge in the right direction.Related...Black, Hispanic And Asian Babies Born Very Early Are Less Likely To Receive Lifesaving MeasuresI Taught My 4th Grade Class About White Privilege And Their Response Was Eye-OpeningThe Culture War Is Chasing Teachers Away, Leaving Kids Shortchanged",

    "category": "",

    "source_domain": "HuffPost",
    "maintext": "On a recent date with a non-Asian man, I mentioned that I wanted to read more about Asian women\u2019s struggles, especially in America. He scratched his head and wondered out loud, \u201cAsian women\u2019s struggles?\u201d To him, Asian women did not struggle. Data shows that we are favored by men on dating apps, and stereotypes suggest that we are \u201csmart\u201d enough to get ahead in the world, \u201cdocile\u201d and \u201csubmissive,\u201d and \u201csmall,\u201d \u201ccute\u201d and non-threatening. How could we struggle, right?My date did express sympathy for Asian women who are harassed and assaulted on the streets, as well as sadness about the recent deaths of Michelle Go and Christina Yuna Lee in New York. But he didn\u2019t appear to grasp the oppression and erasure that Asian women experience regularly, outside of physical violence. Much of the anti-Asian sentiment that we can\u2019t see serves as a seed for physical violence. But even when it doesn\u2019t, it hurts and it holds us back.Advertisement\n\nTherein lies the problem with #StopAsianHate. It has a limited definition of what racism toward us looks and feels like on a daily basis. Many acts of hatred toward Asian women are rooted in Asian misogyny, which is often disguised as a popular and accepted narrative about \u201cloving\u201d or preferring Asian women. Without looking at how Asian women in America have been regarded throughout time, we can\u2019t really understand (and destroy) the current ecosystem of Asian hate. While it sounds counterintuitive, receiving love as an Asian woman can involve the residue of a specific type of xenophobia. Some white women, for instance, fought to keep Asian women in America when it was popular to exclude them. But their intentions weren\u2019t exactly noble: Without Asian women\u2019s domestic service, their homes would have been a mess, and, well, they would have had to mop their own floors. Some of these white women claimed that they loved Asian women. But their \u201cadvocacy\u201d reflected a stereotype that harms us to this day, instilling the idea that we are no more than service workers, a labor force both disposable and cheap. And despite Andrew Yang\u2019s jokes about Asians being good at math (which implies that we\u2019re predominantly highly employable, white-collar workers), in 2020, Asian Americans made up the highest share of long-term unemployed workers in America. It\u2019s a warped, transactional and dehumanizing 'love' of Asian women that leaves us vulnerable as our community remains divided and as people deny, overlook, forget and erase our journey.Advertisement\n\nWanting and appreciating us as submissive assistants isn\u2019t real love. Recognizing only parts of us without seeing us as whole humans deserving of equal rights isn\u2019t love. Real love, to my ancestors, would have looked like a collective fight for their rights to citizenship and social and financial equity, not just for their ability to serve white households. It\u2019s time for us to recognize that unchecked mentality that still exists today. People may want to date us \u2014 because they fetishize us as exotic, hypersexual, and excited to submit to a male partner. But we are rarely voted for and are unlikely to lead entire organizations at which white people work. In dating and at work, there\u2019s a palpable difference between being desired and being valued. Many Asian women have experienced the former quite intensely. Very few have experienced the latter. Asian women have yet to be seen for the totality of our humanity, supported in our ambitions and lifted from our assigned place as secondary so we can lead the masses. It\u2019s no accident that feminist activists of the Asian diaspora such as Grace Lee Boggs, Patsy Mink, Mabel Lee and Evelyn Yoshimaru are not household names. We deserve to strongly influence the public discourse and make decisions that impact millions. Relegating us to the back is a form of violence, and in order to actively stop Asian hate, we have to unearth every form of it and address it head-on.Truly loving Asian women also means letting go of the model minority myth. We are not and shouldn\u2019t be expected to be people of silent resilience whose suffering is effectively erased to attack another minority group. White supremacy, if you haven\u2019t noticed, \u201cloves\u201d Asian people. A U.S. News and World Report published in 1966 read, \u201cAt a time when it is being proposed that hundreds of billions be spent to uplift Negroes and other minorities, the nation\u2019s 300,000 Chinese-Americans are moving ahead on their own\u2014with no help from anyone else.\u201d White supremacist propaganda like this perpetuates systemic oppression of other minority groups, all while denying the struggles of the Asian people. Deeming us a model minority is an implicit recruitment of Asian people into a group that oppresses without removing our own minority status in any other real ways. Advertisement\n\nThe uptick in assaults on Asian American women has awakened the country in some ways \u2014 but we\u2019re only beginning to surface other types of violence we experience on a day-to-day basis. It is frustratingly challenging to convince people that the Atlanta shooting was racially motivated when it\u2019s obvious that the victims were seen as disposable. It is equally frustrating to always remind people to ask themselves \u201cwhy her?\u201d whenever an Asian woman such as Michelle Go or Christina Yuna Lee is harassed, attacked, stalked and murdered. It\u2019s a warped, transactional and dehumanizing \u201clove\u201d of Asian women that leaves us vulnerable as our community remains divided and as people deny, overlook, forget and erase our journey. For those who want to be a better advocate from within the community or outside of it, examine how you may be participating in systemic oppression. A step toward progress might come from determining whether your love serves us or just holds us back.",

The reading lists challenge harmful Indigenous stereotypes often found in media and teach Canadian histories\u2014the residential school system, and the forced removal of Indigenous kids from their homes into foster care during the Sixties Scoop, for instance\u2014that have been historically overlooked in classrooms.The push to introduce kids to Indigenous writing is in line with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s Calls to Action, which recommend a mandatory \u201cage-appropriate curriculum on residential schools, Treaties, and Aboriginal peoples\u2019 historical and contemporary contributions to Canada\u201d for students in Kindergarten through Grade 12. VICE spoke to four Indigenous writers to hear what they think about the overhaul.'You\u2019re conditioning a whole generation of people to only understand one voice'Waubgeshig Rice, Moon of the Crusted Snow, Wasauksing First Nation, OntarioImage courtesy of Waubgeshig Rice. It\u2019s a great sign when school boards are willing to take the initiative to include a wider array of voices. It wasn\u2019t like that at all when I was in high school; I was exposed to Indigenous literature outside of the classroom. An aunt of mine who was a teacher recognized I was into English and creative writing. She gave me Thomas King and Richard Wagamese. I was fortunate that she showed me some of that great work that was happening, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have known. When I talk to other people who were in Ontario in the \u201890s, we all basically read the same books. Think about it: you\u2019re conditioning a whole generation of people to only understand one voice. It\u2019s great that kids nowadays are seeing a more diverse reading list.Advertisement'I felt like an initiative instead of a person'Terese Mailhot, Heart Berries: A Memoir, Seabird Island Band, British ColumbiaImage courtesy of Terese Mailhot.It\u2019s important to try to understand or look at something through an Indigenous lens. It\u2019s also important to showcase a craft perspective, like how Indigenous literature can teach writers about scene, story, and setting. The school board is minimal in its efforts, especially if it\u2019s a specified, compartmentalized, finite amount of time during which you\u2019ll be exposed to an Indigenous lens.EnvironmentIndigenous Artists Tell Us What They Think About Land AcknowledgementsGraham Isador08.09.19We also have to craft lessons to the sensibilities of a young person. I have a son who is 14 and I understand the power of exposing him to a Native author in his own curriculum\u2014he\u2019d be really happy with that. He\u2019s currently reading typical texts like To Kill a Mockingbird. These are dated books that are supposed to teach you something about race. If my son were to read something like Indian Horse, he would feel represented and he\u2019d learn something about Canadian Indigenous history.These across-the-board measures remind me of when I was at school and teachers would say we have to tolerate each other. I felt like an initiative instead of a person. We can always do more.'Let\u2019s have a balanced curriculum that includes Indigenous voices'David Robertson, The Evolution of Alice, Norway House Cree Nation, ManitobaImage courtesy of David Robertson.It strikes me as odd that we are replacing literature at a Grade 11 level with Indigenous literature, but we are presumably leaving the curriculum as it is in Grades 9, 10, and 12. There\u2019s value in integrating Indigenous literature into the curriculum at all levels. I\u2019m not saying let\u2019s replace all literature, but let\u2019s have a balanced curriculum that includes Indigenous voices in all grades.AdvertisementBut I know enough teachers to know they are trying their best. Any movement towards integrating Indigenous literature into the curriculum is positive, considering these things were never taught as early as 15 to 20 years ago. A school board reaches a number of future leaders\u2014children\u2014and can expose them to literature that teaches about Indigenous peoples and history and values. Schools really need to take that seriously. We all have our roles and in the end, what we need to be doing is listening to stories, sharing out stories, and seeing each other in stories.It\u2019s a really good time to be in this country because we have so many people telling important stories and they\u2019re all at our fingertips. Richard Van Camp, Eden Robinson, Waubgeshig Rice, Katherena Vermette\u2014I\u2019ve left out a bunch of people and they\u2019re all amazing.'See what First Nation schools in your district are doing'Trevor Jang, freelance feature writer, Wet'suwet'en Nation, British ColumbiaImage courtesy of Trevor Jang. Having more mandatory Indigenous literature in the school system is important for two main reasons: educate non-Indigenous youth about the history of colonization and how those impacts are still lingering, and for Indigenous youth to see themselves represented in curriculum, particularly in the mainstream system.When I was growing up, I always knew that I was First Nations, but I never understood what that means largely due to the residential school system and the Sixties Scoop. My mom was Indigenous and she never got the opportunity to be immersed in culture, so she never got to pass that onto me. I never got to learn about that in school or in English class, and it wasn\u2019t until I became an adult that I began to discover what being Indigenous means. If I was forced by a teacher to read Indigenous literature, it might have opened up my pursuit into my identity a lot sooner.Regarding best practice, you have to engage local nations within districts. Most school districts have some sort of Indigenous education specialist or manager or principal, so engage with local nations. They\u2019ll have committees of elders and curriculum material for on-reserve schools. See what First Nation schools in your district are doing and engage them.Interviews have been edited for length and clarity.Follow Anya Zoledziowski on Twitter.",

All you Arabs and Democrats, go back where you came from,\u201d he says in a video posted to Twitter.The man was standing at the Michael Kors counter in the store and looking to buy a handbag. But when the employee behind the counter told him he\u2019d have to go to a different part of the store to get his purchase gift-wrapped, he got mad and demanded that the purse come with a box; the employees didn\u2019t have one.AdvertisementAs the situation escalated, several other shoppers stepped in to speak up on the employees\u2019 behalf.\u201cLeave the store. She already told you,\u201d a bystander says in the video. \u201cThere\u2019s not a gift box for that.

    "maintext": "\u201cDon\u2019t take anything from the forest. The ones who have taken even a single leaf or stone suffer misfortune. Even death,\u201d warns John Starfield Myrthong\u2014referred to as just Starfield by his friends\u2014almost philosophically as he takes me through the sacred forest of Mawphlang village, a major tourist attraction in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya. Said to be protected by a deity named Labasa, this sacred grove is known for its tales of punishment, trees with human-like faces and a \u2018strange magnetic pull\u2019.AdvertisementShort and athletic, Starfield is a local guide from Mawphlang, loved by his friends and elders of his village. And yet, he is unlike any other tour guide I have come across. With a gift of the gab and a distinct\u2014albeit familiar\u2014boyish charm, Starfield is just 22 with the wisdom of a nonagenarian, and a demeanour that appears straight out of a boisterous movie role. He is also a fourth-standard dropout, a circumstance that was shaped by limited financial resources\u2014something many young boys go through in the state where the trend has accelerated over the last four years.However, Starfield refused to let this define his life.As a kid, John Starfield would accompany tourists for free just to sharpen his English language.Six years ago, the only English words this boy knew were \u201chello\u201d, \u201cwelcome\u201d, \u201ccome here\u201d and \u201cbye bye\u201d. This was before one of his friends gave him a DVD of Home Alone, the movie that initiated Starfield into Hollywood. Soon, he was binge-watching Hollywood movies, downloading the subtitles, and practising accents with the sole purpose of learning English.For Starfield, learning English means a better status in society, earning respect of the villagers and, of course, furthering his career as a tour guide, a profession that requires for him to interact with at least five visitors every day. \u201cFor most boys my age, the only options are farming, getting a government job like the police forces, or becoming a tour guide,\u201d he tells me. Rising unemployment and migration of youth to cities such as Guwahati and Shillong is a major issue that is affecting the state\u2019s politics. The government has expressed concerns about decreasing employability due to reasons such as lack of industrialisation, the small service sector, and an under-developed agricultural landscape.AdvertisementStarfield\u2019s foray into the English language also comes from his love for war and action films such as Hitman, Rocky and Rambo. His favourite film, though, is Titanic. \u201cI think it has a very interesting story of struggle and love. It stars my favourite actress Kate Winslet. I don\u2019t like [Leonardo] DiCaprio that much,\u201d says Starfield whose heart beats for action stars such as Sylvester Stallone and Jackie Chan. His favourite genre is boxing. \u201cI used to do boxing at one point,\u201d he tells me.As a boy, Starfield would guide the tourists without fee to hone this new-found language skill. \u201cI was well-known as the kid who talks a lot. Some gave me a packet of biscuit for accompanying them, while a few others would give a little money. I never asked for it,\u201d he says. He would try to talk to every new person who came to Mawphlang, from tourists to truck drivers (from whom he picked up some Hindi). Now an experienced tour guide, Starfield is fluent in English, Hindi and a bit of Bengali, earning up to \u20b910,000-\u20b912,000 per month, \u201cmore than many who completed school\u201d.How green is my valley: Starfield draws his wisdom from the mountains and forests he grew up in.Becoming a tour guide was not his dream. Starfield wanted to become a cop or a marathon runner. In 2012, he won a championship of marathon, which he thought would help him get into the police force. \u201cI was counting on someone I knew who knew a minister, the way to get such a job, but was disqualified at the interview level,\u201d says Starfield, who was asked for a bribe to get ahead, but he couldn\u2019t afford it. Almost every young boy in his village wants to get a government job, he adds. \u201cThat is the only ticket to a respectable life. The only rich people here are the government officials,\u201d he says.As Starfield\u2019s life plays out\u2014one trek at a time\u2014the glue that holds it all together is the slow, comfortable life of Mawphlang, away from the \u201cselfish and political\u201d city life. \u201cWe eat good food here, breathe clean air and diseases are rare. The only ones who die early are the ones who drink too much rice beer. Even some drunkards live well into the 90s,\u201d he says. Starfield never completed his studies, but he urges other kids to contribute to the village. \u201cI want to teach kids from poor families how to earn money their own way. A lot of young boys come to me to learn Hindi and English. I help as much as I can,\u201d he says.Starfield\u2014who claims to have accompanied Bollywood personalities such as Farah Khan for treks\u2014ultimately draws his wisdom from the mountains and forests he grew up in. \u201cOur life is much more difficult than the ones who live in the plains, but it also teaches us. When you walk in a forest, the right path often leads through stones and an upward climb to the hill. Here, you will find your way only if you work hard for it.\u201dFollow Zeyad Masroor Khan on Twitter.",

    "maintext": "Since its pilot episode, HBO\u2019s Westworld has used dream sequences to channel the show\u2019s central theme of awakening into consciousness. The park\u2019s robotic hosts, haunted by shadowy memories that hint at their past lives and deaths, learn to follow these recollective landmarks out of the conceptual maze of their programming.For Maeve Millay (Thandie Newton), these dreams manifest as idyllic memories of her young daughter, and then take a horrific turn when the child is abducted by a member of the park\u2019s indigenous Ghost Nation. It\u2019s Maeve\u2019s worst nightmare, which is why it was so gut-wrenching to see it come true in the June 3 episode \"Les \u00c9corch\u00e9s.\"AdvertisementBut in \u201cKiksuya,\u201d which aired Sunday night, Maeve comes to realize that this long-dreaded kidnapping is an act of grace\u2014a rescue. The secret behind her epiphany? Her newfound fluency in all the park\u2019s languages. With this development, the show has established that unlocking multilingualism is not only a potent superpower for hosts, it could also be their greatest unifier against the human tourists.Indeed, \u201cKiksuya\u201d\u2014meaning \u201cremember\u201d in Lakota\u2014is the second example of Westworld making a deliberate choice to advance the plot largely through non-English dialog (the first being \u201cAkane no Mai,\u201d a Japanese language episode set in Shogun World).\u201cKiksuya\u201d unflinchingly allows Akecheta (Zahn McClarnon)\u2014the spectre of Maeve\u2019s nightmares\u2014to divulge his story in Lakota to Maeve\u2019s daughter. As a plot device, this means that the Man in Black (Ed Harris), who lies nearby riddled with bullet holes, cannot eavesdrop on the tale. But more importantly, it alludes to the enormous significance of freely speaking one\u2019s language of heritage.This is an especially poignant point for American indigenous peoples, who suffered generations of forced linguistic assimilation in residential boarding schools. To lose a language is to lose identity, and Westworld seems to have been building on this premise, which dovetails with its central themes, across several episodes.Indeed, for Aketcheta to recall his past in Lakota is itself a sign of his deliverance from Westworld\u2019s predestined script. His anchor is the memory of the sweet nothings he exchanged with his lover Kohana. She once told him: \u201cMi cante ki yu ha ya ye\u201d (\u201cTake my heart when you go\u201d). As implied by the name of the episode, he does not forget, and it\u2019s this memory that leads him out of his own cognitive maze.AdvertisementThe phrase returns to close the episode in a beautiful twist that confirms Akecheta is using Lakota to commune directly with Maeve. He knows that even as she lies bloodied and ravaged on a gurney at the Mesa Hub, she can hear and decipher his intentions to safeguard her daughter. Maeve\u2019s fearful memories of him, informed by race-based prejudices that are coded into the park, evaporate when she hears his version of events in his own tongue. \u201cMi cante ki yu ha ya ye,\u201d she responds to him.Read More: If Rich People Are the Variables in \u2018Westworld,\u2019 No Wonder the Experiment SucksThis powerful kicker adds new dimensions to Maeve\u2019s encounter with her Japanese counterpart Akane, who is forced to witness the murder of her own daughter figure, Sakura. Akane literally removes Sakura\u2019s heart as part of her funeral rites, taking it with her as she goes. The parallel implies that fluency in many languages is a signifier of a growing heartfelt connection between hosts. It\u2019s a welcome sentimental layer to a show that is often more fixated on the cerebral.Plus, it\u2019s refreshing as a viewer to be exposed to new languages, especially in light of the rise of language militancy in English-speaking countries. The recent viral video of lawyer Aaron Schlossberg harassing restaurant workers for speaking Spanish underscores a broad upswing in language policing in American culture, and demonstrates how intimidating the sound of foreign words can apparently be for some people.This is especially troubling because research has correlated multilingualism with greater cognitive abilities, capacity for tolerance, and economic benefits, compared to monolingualism. In real life, as in Westworld, immersion in multiple languages\u2014or even just basic respect for those who speak them\u2014is a reliable route through the maze of a rigid worldview.Get six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.",

    "maintext": "In high school, it's not uncommon for teachers to subject their students to new and innovative ways of learning, like showing that cat intestines can be used to jump rope, for instance. But last week, some students witnessed their teacher doing something disturbing when they caught her doing drugs in her classroom during the middle of a school day, the Chicago Tribune reports.Last Wednesday, junior Will Rogers noticed his English teacher, Samantha Cox, 24, was up to something strange in the corner of her classroom. As teens are wont to do, he pulled out his phone and started filming, recording her through the window of the locked classroom door. The footage shows Cox pushing what looks like white powder into lines on a book, then bending over to snort it off her desk.Advertisement\"She\u2019s in the corner, hiding with a chair and a book and what appears to be cocaine, putting it into lines,\u201d Rogers told Chicago's WGN-TV. \"When I actually watched the footage again and again and I just realized that my English teacher just did cocaine.\"And because teens today are apparently very anti-drug, a few students who saw what went down told administrators at Lake Central High School, who then called the cops. Police then brought down a drug-sniffing dog to Cox's room and found \"a clear tightly twisted bag with multiple small rolled up pieces of tin foil' and \"a rolled up small piece of paper,\" which they said could be \"used to ingest illegal narcotics through one\u2019s nostril,\" the Tribune reports.The cops arrested Cox and marched her out of the school in handcuffs while at least one student filmed the whole thing on Snapchat. Investigators found a range of other drug paraphernalia in her car, including a glass pipe and two more paper straws, the Tribune reports.According to CBS Chicago, Cox admitted to bringing coke into the school in an interview with police, telling investigators she'd bought $160 worth of \"dope cocaine\" from her dealer that morning and snuck it into her empty classroom during a break\u2014minutes before Rogers started filming.Lake Central schools Superintendent Larry Veracco said he was happy the incident was dealt with swiftly\u2014but that at the end of the day, the whole fiasco is a pretty major bummer.\"She was popular with the students,\" Veracco told the Northwest Indiana Times. \"It's a sad situation. We are happy that we got her removed from the classroom very quickly after being tipped off by a student. But we are also concerned about her welfare, too. She seemed to be a very good teacher.\"Cox now faces charges of possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia, according to a police statement, which adds her to the growing list of teachers caught doing messed-up shit at school.Follow Drew Schwartz on Twitter.",

    "maintext": "Bonsai is a Japanese art form that involves pinching and pruning the branches of ornamental trees in order to prevent them from reaching their normal size. The practice dates back thousands of yearsand is traditionally seen as a meditative exercise and vehicle for contemplation. Manchester-based artist Andy Elliott says he experiences a similar therapeutic sensation when he creates his bonsai tree sculptures using strands of wire. Elliott first started making bonsai sculptures as a hobby and has slowly perfected the craft over time. Last year he started what turned out to be a successful Kickstarter campaign to help raise money for materials. He has since then undertook a second larger campaign, taking commissions and putting work up on his Etsy page.AdvertisementElliott is a prolific craftsman and has developed a significant following on his YouTube channel, where he posts videos on how to make things like an LED illusion mirror or a miniature grapple gun. His sculptures are based off a bonsai shape but also imagine a tree that is sliced in half so you can see the details of the branches inside. Each tree is a made from a number of strands of wire. Using jigs, pliers, and an array of other tools, Elliott twists the wire into tiny loops to create bunches of leaves. Elliott says some of his largest trees can use up hundreds of meters worth of wire and take up to a week to complete.

    "maintext": "This post originally appeared on VICE UK.This Saturday, Seattle Sounders fans will travel 2,500 miles coast to coast to will their team to victory against Toronto FC in the MLS Cup final. It's the kind of migration that feels like it should be narrated by David Attenborough and says a lot about the role that tribalism is able to play in a country where supporters are routinely confronted with journeys that make the trek from Plymouth to Carlisle in England\u2014at 389 miles, the longest away day in English soccer at present\u2014look like a hungover traipse to the store.AdvertisementIt's interesting to consider the value of ritual and tradition in a soccer nation that tends to draw for novelty to sustain attention. In the last few years, it's not just been soccer players and coaches that the MLS has imported; a way of supporting a lifestyle and culture of devotion has been shipped in, too, most obviously from the Premier League and Bundesliga. But really it's impossible to talk about the state of North American fandom without first\u2014what's the right word? Absorbing? Experiencing?\u2014enduring this video:Now that that's out of the way, we can get on with answering the pressing question at hand: Just why do Americans love bicycle kicks so much?~The 1994 World Cup was held in the United States. It was the first international tournament I can (just about) remember, and by virtue of me being a kid and the witching hour kick-off times, I had to watch all the games in secret on a shit TV in my room, face pressed right up against the screen with the volume on 1 so I could hear if the stairs creaked. My house was built by idiots and creaked of its own accord often, and after every false alarm, I'd have to creep back to the TV, turn it on again, and manually retune the channel because none of the preset buttons worked. But it was all worth it: Gheorghe Hagi's absurd lob against Colombia, Kennet Andersson doing the same to Brazil, Jack Charlton\u2014who, you'd think, if you've ever seen him blast the head off a stag with a shotgun, would be ecstatic just to be in a country with such lax gun control laws\u2014having a tantrum in the Orlando heat, the iridescent kits gleaming like brand-new colors in the sun, the world's saddest ponytail, the world's most obviously drugged-up genius\u2014the whole world of soccer, basically, gloriously England-free, on parade before me for the first time in my furtive satellite town panopticon.AdvertisementIt was a tournament of so many moments, proto-gifs that seemed to lodge themselves in the consciousness of a generation. But there was one moment from that tournament which, for obvious reasons, appears to have taken on a greater resonance to Americans in particular. And it's this\u2026[daily_motion src='//www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x31fjgf?start=50' width='560' height='315']Chicagoan defender Marcelo Balboa, attempting to score direct from a corner with a bicycle kick.Why does any of this matter? The relationship that the US has with the bicycle kick is emblematic of its relationship to the game as a whole. Balboa failed, obviously, but that's not the point. The extent to which Americans have struggled to love soccer due to its chaotic, freeform nature, its attritional, low-scoring routes to victory, defeat or parity has often been overstated, but while the tide seems to slowly be turning amid a sea of stats-crazed Yanks getting into the game, it's still difficult to escape the feeling that its popularity would increase relative to other American sports if only it could be a little more cinematic\u2014if it were something that took place in short, scripted bursts, and had a more obvious plot line than any that could be offered up by 22 players relentlessly shifting in and out of position with very little downtime to analyze and draw breath in between. I've often found it difficult, too, to get my head around the way that so many of the players in the NFL in particular seem to fade into oblivion after a few rare seconds in the spotlight, in a way that supporting cast members like Martin Kelly or Christian Kabasele or Mohammed Elneny just can't in soccer, given the way the game is built and flows.AdvertisementBut a bicycle kick\u2014well, a bicycle kick is probably the most un-soccer thing in soccer. There is something intrinsically staged and showbiz about it\u2014so it's no surprise that, for Americans, a bicycle kick direct from a corner in a home World Cup by a man with a funny mustache, a mullet, and a fictional Hollywood boxer's name is about as relatable as it gets, even if he missed. In this second of glorious, sunlit failure, Balboa defines America's relationship to soccer. And if you think that's a stretch, listen to these commentators react to a bicycle kick scored just this season by itinerant Italian carthorse Amauri, from all of six yards. Pray they never whack the words \"Trevor Sinclair Barnsley\" into YouTube; you doubt they'd survive it.~Which brings us back, all the way back, to this man: Robby Branom. Branom is a strange dude with a loud job, an unfortunate combination for someone who doesn't seem to know where or who he is. He is, in a strictly biographical sense, a pretty pleasant-seeming white American guy who, according to the internet wormhole over my shoulder, got a solid degree and works at an energy company. He is a pretty pleasant-seeming white American guy who once got married, but crucially he is both all of this and someone who, in his spare time, goes down to the CenturyLink Field and functions as a \"capo\" for his beloved Seattle Sounders, leading his fellow fans in chants that he devised, he says, after the trips he makes to Europe \"just about every summer\u2026 I've learned the trade, you know? How it really works.\"AdvertisementI'm not sure which European summer league Mr. Branom has been watching. I'm not sure to what extent this really \"works\":I'm not saying that Americans aren't allowed to care about their soccer team. That would be absurd and especially cold-hearted given the circumstances\u2014Seattle's appearance in the MLS Cup final will be the first in their history, and I will be thinking of Branom on Saturday, hoping that a man who has watched his side through years of relative mediocrity is entirely excited, hopeful, and proud of his team, that he is exhilarated by the rare prospect of his love for Seattle Sounders being requited by success. But where it starts to get jarring for me is the naked, misplaced Anglophilia. I can't get past it. His personality in the video below seems like a dentist's waiting room of bad English stereotypes: Austin Powers, Dr. Who, Willy Fog, Neville Longbottom, Klamer the pretentious community college student, Hugh Grant, Gandalf, Shit Break\u2014they're all here, talking like Alex Jones's impression of a British person, dressed like a rugby fan:When I try to pinpoint why Robby Branom makes me feel uncomfortable, I can think of lots of reasons. Perhaps it's because, like so many depressing forces at work in this country at the minute, he represents a yearning for an England that never really existed. Perhaps it's because his own childlike and apparently cynicism-free love for the game puts the desperate, angst-ridden seething I feel twice a week into sharp and unflattering relief. But perhaps it's just because it looks like a lot of unnecessary work trying so hard to be someone else. It feels like he's turned his persona into an apology for America's lack of soccer tribalism, made himself a screaming totem to his own internal neuroses about whether or not MLS fans are doing fandom in the \"correct\" way. He makes me feel uneasy in the same way that actors in \"immersive theater experiences\" do\u2014you wanna grab his face and shake him around, tell him that it's OK, that he doesn't have to pretend anymore.AdvertisementFans of Toronto FC, the Sounders' opponents in Sunday's cup final, have a history of making themselves look like dickheads, too, most famously in the video below, where they launch into an impassioned chant of \"the referee's a wanker\":Crucially, the game had yet to kick off, which means that rather than this being a targeted, ad hominem assault on whoever officiated it, the Toronto fans must have been railing instead against the abstract concept of the referee, the notion of some independent adjudicator imposing the laws of the sport rather than allowing it to descend into a free-for-all with no set laws, objective, beginning or end, a hallucinogenic scrimmage in a pit of mud, blood, and shit that reaches out into eternity until it ceases to resemble a game at all and becomes a piece of performance art comparable in scale with global warming or modernism as one of humanity's grand historical projects. This, in fairness, sounds like a laugh, but it doesn't quite sit right coming from the mouths of North Americans\u2014people who, as I've already argued at length, tend to prefer a bit more structure to their hobbies.The apex of all this imported partisanship has arrived, unquestionably, in the fresh rivalry between New York Red Bulls and New York City FC, a hatred that nobody's calling the \"Hudson River Derby.\" To give them their due, fans of the two clubs have shown they possess a flair for nomenclature\u2014Red Bulls groups include the Garden State Ultras and the Viking Army Supporters Club, and they sit in designated parts of the Red Bull Arena known collectively as the \"South Ward.\" The first official NYCFC fan group calls itself the\" Third Rail\" after the steel conductor rail that electrifies the city's subway system. These are all decent uses of words. Which only makes it all the more weird that, when fans of the two clubs had an underwhelming quarrel in New Jersey last August, they couldn't get a three-syllable chant right:AdvertisementAlso, it was outside a place proudly claiming to be \"Newark's first gastro pub\":A battleground only outdone in irony levels by this Hard Rock Cafe:Again, certain questions are raised, chiefly: What exactly is this rivalry\u2014between a team bankrolled by an energy drink and another formed in 2015\u2014built on? And is it really a loathing so deep-set that it's worth testing the patience of a load of American police officers, when American police officers carry guns, which are deadly weapons that those officers haven't exactly proven themselves shy of using?And this is the crux, really, it is the terrace culture of English soccer that MLS fans are most clearly aping, and yet there are things about English football that you just can't ape. For example, you could argue that at the height of its infamy, English hooliganism was fueled by a poisonous cocktail of dying industry, regional resentment, mass unemployment, racial tension, a war on class loyalty, cruel government, corrupt policing, and fading empire. And you could argue that American hooliganism is fueled by the mostly fictional account of a hobbit getting beaten up at a West Ham match. The two aren't really comparable, though that didn't stop these NYCFC fans\u2014supporters of a team, remember, that was formed last year, bankrolled by Abu Dhabi oil money\u2014throwing their weight behind the anti-corporate, anti-petrodollar \"Against Modern Soccer\" movement:Despite our absence from the tournament itself, the World Cup that took place in the States in 1994 was in many ways a watershed moment for English soccer. It was the last World Cup before the Premier League and Sky had really taken off, the last World Cup before anyone here knew anything about leagues overseas beyond the fact that Gabriel Batistuta could hit a ball very hard, the last World Cup before Championship Manager and the internet and the importing of foreign players and coaches exploded, the last World Cup before we as a country, for better or worse, lost our soccer innocence, our ability to arrive every two years at an international tournament and not know the names on the shirts, the styles of play, the biographies beyond the funny haircuts. My overriding memories of USA '94 are of surprise and identity\u2014teams that arrived as mysteries and left as distinct entities I still remember vividly to this day, an unusual number of whom were led by charismatic, dictatorial number 10s: Hagi, Stoichkov, Maradona, Baggio, Valderrama, Rai, Dahlin, Matthaus, Okocha, Scifo, Bergkamp. There was an absence of the familiarity and homogeneity that can sometimes spoil things today\u2014which is why it feels a bit depressing to witness Americans attempting to ape English terrace culture.Not that I wish Robby Branom anything but the best of luck in Sunday's game. I hope that Seattle wins and that this first taste of glory helps him see that culture is something built from the ground up\u2014out of memory, loyalty, and time. And what would make me really happy is if Seattle's winning goal is a bicycle kick, scored directly from a corner, by a man with a funny mustache, a mullet, and a fictional Hollywood boxer's name. Which would seem to rule out Tyrone Mears.Follow Kev Kharas on Twitter.",

    "maintext": "With the youth unemployment rate in Canada sitting at around 13 percent and broke young people moving back into their parents' houses in droves, it's never been more important to have marketable skills.But is university really the solution? While few people doubt the value of a post-secondary education, it's also probably true that in practical terms, not all degrees are created equal. A business administration degree, for example, would generally be considered more handy when it comes to applying for jobs than a degree is semiotics (whatever the hell that entails).AdvertisementOn top of that, university tuition has gone up 40 percent in the last decade, according to Statistics Canada. If you're gonna be saddled with a bunch of student debt, you eventually want to be able to earn enough of an income to pay it off. VICE caught up with university grads who hold what are considered to be some of the most useless degrees to see how they fared in the real world:Skyler Oxley, 35\nPhilosophy at Concordia UniversityVICE: Why philosophy?\nSkylar Oxley:I was 19 years old and full of existential despair; I thought that studying philosophy would both help me understand what life is and that it would also be interesting.Did that end up being true?\nYes and no. It certainly helped me clarify the questions I had about life and helped me realize that there are many other people out there asking these questions. But it didn't answer the questions; I still felt confused, just less alone, perhaps.Hmm so what were your biggest questions that you hoped to answer?\nI suppose: \"Why does all this exist?\" and \"What, if anything, am I supposed to do while I exist?\"Read more: Debt, Depression, and Dud Degrees: Why Would Anyone Go to University?Speaking of, were you ever worried about how you would incorporate your degree into the real world?Well, not as much as I should have been. My parents kept warning me about that.What were they saying? Did they pay for your education?\nThey seemed simultaneously happy that I was studying something I was interested in and worried because they knew how poor the job prospects were. They'd say things like \"what are you going to do when you finish?\" and \"you'd better start thinking about getting some skills.\" And yes, they had invested in something since I was quite young, so while I did work during university I also did not have to take any loans.AdvertisementSo what did you end up doing?\nAfter I finished philosophy I moved back to Vancouver and worked at Chapters. There seemed to be a lot of people there who had degrees in the liberal arts and who were doing retail. But eventually I did more university and got into a field at McGill, they had a two-year social work program, so I got into that and have been working in the mental health field for the last eight years. I eventually did a masters at the University of Toronto too in counselling psychology.Wow you did a lot of fucking school\nYes, I did far too much. I'm actually embarrassed about having three degrees.Where a lot of liberal arts grads end up, apparently. Photo via Flickr user G.e.o.r.g.e Jessica Barrett, 33\nBachelor of Fine Arts focusing on contemporary dance, minor in philosophy Grant MacEwan College/Simon Fraser UniversitySo what made you go into dance?\nI had done it my whole life and went to a fine arts junior high and high school. And when I got close to graduating I still had no idea what I was going to do after high school. I wanted to take a gap year but my dad wasn't super keen on the idea, and he would be paying for my post-secondary as per my parents' divorce settlement. Then my high school dance teacher suggested I pursue dance at the college level.Were you happy?\nAt university, no. I loved it in college, thrived even. But at university I felt lost. And I really just kept going because I was already halfway to a degree, this piece of paper that I was supposed to have.AdvertisementHow did you feel after you got your degree?\nMeh. It was super uneventful. I didn't even go to my convocation. I found university to be impersonal and cold and kind of pointless. Or maybe just no one explained to me how to do it properly. Like how to pick classes and professors that were inspiring and good.Where'd you end up after?\nI taught dance and worked at Lululemon and saved money to travel to South America. And I did some choreography and other performing. About two years after I got my degree I went to Langara College as a \"mature\" student for journalism. I was 25. I think I realized my degree\u2014and not just mine but most people's\u2014was basically worth nothing from an employment standpoint.Kinda nuts that you can get a degree in this tbh. Photo via Flickr user alyssa.becker Knowing what you know now about degrees vs diplomas, college vs university, would you do anything differently?\nNo. I think part of me is a bit sad that I didn't get as much out of university as I could have, because I am super privileged to have been able to go, and have my parents pay for it. I do wish I had pushed harder for a gap year to figure out what I was interested in. And to be a little older. Seventeen is so young to be in that environment and if I hadn't gone to college first I would have drowned in it. Even at 20 I found it overwhelming. Universities to some degree kind of function like daycares for young adults we don't know what else to do with.Jesse S., 37\nComparative Religions, minor in near and middle eastern civilizations, University of TorontoAdvertisementSo your undergrad sounds fairly .. unique. Why were you interested in that?\nI was just following my passions at the time. My uncle is a well-recognized biblical scholar so there was some influence there, even if he never recognized my undergrad efforts. I was, and still am, interested in what makes people tick, and how we see the world around us. I also secretly wanted the degree so I could start a cult. I never got around to it but, at least I'm qualified.What kind of cult?\nWell, it would be a benevolent one, not the malignant kind that takes advantage of followers and requires that they give up all their funds and material possessions to the leader of the group.So like the pastafarians?\nSure.While you were studying did you ever worry about how the stuff you were learning would translate into the real world?\nNo, not really. I was surrounded by thousands of others of humanities students with not very practical degrees. We were all in it together. Strength in numbers right?And you were enjoying what you were doing?\nYes, I still value academia. While I came to my sense towards the end of my undergrad and realized that going to study Buddhism on the beach in Hawaii for a master program, (or retreating to live in the caves with Saddhus in India, a boyhood fantasy at the time, which I may revisit one day) may not be the most practical use of my time, my thirst for knowledge is realDid you pay for your own schooling?\nNo.AdvertisementWhat are you doing now?\nI'm currently working as a digital marketing specialist with a focus on social media. In the past I was an arts/culture/lifestyle journalist.So not really anything related to your degree\nIt was a cultural degree. I work in culture. It's loosely based on it.Graham Reeder, 25\nHuman ecology, College of the AtlanticWhat even is human ecology?\nMy diploma may as well have just said: \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Human ecology is an interdisciplinary self designed degree, so I was mostly drawn to the idea of taking liberal arts to the extreme, of fundamentally taking control of my educational trajectory by designing my own course of study.Sounds interesting, did you enjoy it?\nYeah I loved it. It could get frustrating at times, there were people there who just took a bunch of intro classes and fucked around for four years and got an indistinguishable degree from me which sometimes felt unfair, but I made peace with that. The motivation of knowing that I had to make myself employable on different terms forced me to get off my ass and do cool things, which I did, and ended up with a far more impressive resume at the end of four years than most poli sci undergrads from universities with name recognition.So you felt like by the time you got your degree you were prepped for the workforce?\nYes and no, I think I had a solid set of skills for the workforce but lacked some of the plush connections that people I know who went to bigger universities had. So I was ready to work but struggled to find it.AdvertisementCollege of the Atlantic looks pretty lit. Photo via Facebook Did you pay for school?\nI guess that was a large factor as well. I had a full scholarship for all four years there. I was thinking of going to U of T, I had an entrance scholarship and a millennium scholarship, but it was still gonna be too much because of cost of living and the fact that I didn't have much saved up or a wealthy family to support me.What are you doing these days?\nWell, I went back to grad school last year, mostly because I knew the stuff I was doing wasn't what I wanted to do my whole life. I'm studying urban planning at the faculty of environmental studies at York University and my degree will be in environmental studies, so once again another pretty useless on paper degree. Apparently it's a habit for me.Do you have a particular career in mind? Would you want to be a planner?\nNot in a formal sense, I'd like to be a policy advisor for cities and urban regions planning for climate change impacts\u2014a job that doesn't really exist yet in most places, but will as time goes on. Kinda weird banking one's career on our collective failure to stop climate change, but here we are.James W., 38\nEnglish literature and film studies (double major), University of TorontoHow did you settle on that double major?\nIt just kind of happened. I'd finished high school, had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, so I signed up for everything. Art history, a biology course, Spanish. At some point I think I had Anglo Saxon in there. Like the dead language. Film and english were the two that stuck. I'm not sure Anglo Saxon would have been significantly less useful.AdvertisementDid you enjoy it while you were doing it? Film and english\u2014not Anglo Saxon\nFor sure. They were things I was interested in. To be clear: I didn't learn to make movies. I learned to watch movies. As in: how is the T-800 really Jesus? In what ways is Marilyn Monroe really just a giant talking penis? That kind of thing.Read more: We Spoke to Students About the Weirdest Degrees You Can Do at UniversityHonestly how did your degree translate into the real world? Did it just make you more annoying to watch movies with?\nIt made me hate smart movies. There are only so many three hour shots of melting ice cream you can watch before you kind of get your fill. Job wise it wasn't a huge asset. I went back to do my masters in journalism. That actually came in pretty handy.Interesting. Journalism is pretty frequently cited on those most useless degrees lists\u2014how did it work out for you?\nI got in before newspapers went extinct. I did an internship, got a job, later started a company. It's still useful when I want to make people believe I can write.Did you pay for school?\nYeah. Jobs plus scholarships. I actually came out of undergrad $3,000 ahead. Free ride to U of T, including money for room and board. It was a pretty sweet deal.Nice, so even though you had kind of a frivolous degree, you wouldn't do anything differently?\nIt's definitely easier to have a degree than not to have a degree. Or at least some kind of post secondary. I have a friend who stopped at a high school diploma. He's in his late 30's, he's smart, has a ton of work experience and useful skills, and the lack of letters still gives him grief. But if I could do it over again I'd probably do something useful like law or medicine. Would have made my life a lot easier. BAs are straight up stupid.

It was in this spirit that he founded Green Cross International.\u201dSecretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres received the Lamp of Peace award on Saturday, a major honour from the Catholic Church, which he said recognizes the work of UN personnel \u201cstriving for peace around the world\u201d.",

    "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubLeaders in Libya must take immediate steps to resolve their political impasse, which is spilling over into increasing violence, UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council on Tuesday.\u00a0The North African country became divided between two rival administrations in the years after the overthrow of former leader Muammar Gaddafi a decade ago. \u00a0The Government of National Accord (GNA) is based in the capital, Tripoli, located in the west, while the Libyan National Army (LNA) is in the east. \u00a0Elections remain the only way to break the current political impasse in #Libya. Any support the parties receive from within or outside the country should serve to unite them, not divide them. My remarks to the Security council today: https://t.co/6gUTvOz0SnDespite relative calm in recent years, tensions have been simmering following the failure to hold long-awaited elections last December, and the refusal of incumbent Prime Minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, to step down.\u00a0Rival Fathi Bashagha, who was appointed Prime Minister by the parliament in the east, has been attempting to enter Tripoli.\u00a0Ms. DiCarlo said she is deeply concerned that the ongoing stalemate and continued delays in implementing the electoral process pose a growing threat to security in and around Tripoli, and potentially to all Libyans.\u00a0\u201cThat threat materialized just a few days ago, when Tripoli was again the theatre of violent clashes between armed groups supporting Mr. Dbeibah and Mr. Bashaga respectively,\u201d she told ambassadors. \u00a0The violence broke out on 27 August, leaving at least 42 people dead, including four civilians, and nearly 160 injured, according to the Libyan authorities. Some 50 families were reportedly displaced, while five health centres and two migrant detention centres were damaged.\u00a0While the fighting subsided the following day, a fragile calm prevails but it is unclear how long it will last.\"In light of the deterioration of the political and security climate in Tripoli, the United Nations must continue to provide and enhance good offices and mediation to help Libyan actors resolve the ongoing impasse and seek a consensual pathway to elections,\" she said.\"I urge everyone to support the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to help Libyans forge a path to peace.\"Ms. DiCarlo was also concerned about the limited political progress towards the elections, which the UN sees as the only way to break the current impasse.\u00a0\u201cDespite our continued efforts, no progress has been made on forging a consensus on a constitutional framework for the elections,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is critical that an agreement is reached on a constitutional framework and timeline for elections that will enable the Libyan people to choose their leaders.\u201d\u00a0The UN political affairs chief did highlight some positive developments, such as the ongoing efforts by the 5+5 Joint Military Commission (JMC) to preserve and strengthen the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.\u00a0The JMC brings together five military representatives each from both sides.\u00a0\u201cOf note, on 27 August the eastern delegation to the JMC called their counterparts in the west to reassure them that the Libyan National Army would not be involved in the fighting,\u201d she reported.\u00a0Earlier this month, the JMC also met with the UN Mission in the country, UNSMIL, to enhance the readiness of the Libyan Ceasefire Monitoring Mechanism. \u00a0They also finalized modalities for the withdrawal of foreign forces, foreign fighters and mercenaries from the territory.\u00a0Turning to economic developments, Ms. DiCarlo reported that oil production resumed in July, following a nearly three-month shutdown. Production had reached pre-shutdown levels of 1.2 million barrels a day by the end of that month, with plans for further increase.\u00a0However, she was worried that oil fields could again close due to growing public discontent in the south over lack of basic services and poor living conditions. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cLibya\u2019s natural resources belong to all Libyans, and revenues from oil exports should be distributed equitably and fairly,\u201d she said.\u00a0Meanwhile the human rights situation in the country continues to be a concern. \u00a0Last week, armed groups affiliated with the Libyan National Army, one of the rival government structures, encircled the town of Qasr Bouhadi. Although these \u201cmilitary actors\u201d have since withdrawn, they continue to control movement there. \u00a0Ms. DiCarlo called for restrictions on the population to be immediately lifted, warning that the situation could escalate.\u00a0She reported on other violations, including against people exercising their right to freedom of expression, migrants and refugees, and women activists.\u00a0\u201cSmear campaigns targeting civil society actors, particularly women, consisting of hate speech and incitements to violence, are deeply concerning and must cease,\u201d she said. \u00a0The overall situation in Libya remains \u201chighly volatile\u201d, Martha Pobee, UN Assistant Secretary-General for political affairs and peace operations,\u00a0told the Security Council on Monday.",

    "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubThe outgoing High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, has told UN News in an interview to mark the end of her term in office that she\u2019s always spoken out and felt free to act, while acknowledging that doing the job is \u201ca constant and permanent struggle\u201d to prevent governments from restricting essential freedoms.\u00a0In an in-depth interview with UN News, ahead of officially leaving her post on Wednesday, the two-time former president of Chile and head of UN Women, looked back over her four years heading her office, OHCHR, and said while human rights had gone backwards in some areas, there have been \u201cimportant steps in others.\u201d\u00a0\u201cAs always in life, you have good moments and difficult moments, and you have to work with both\u201d, she said, adding that she\u2019d never been compelled to keep quiet in the top rights job.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI always felt free to say, or not to say, what I thought it was necessary to do.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0One the issue of the long-awaited report relating to her\u00a0recent visit to China, which has yet to be published, Ms. Bachelet said that she had made her position clear to Chinese officials, and said all that she had come to say, on the first visit by a UN rights chief in 17 years.\u00a0\u00a0She describes running OHCHR as a \u201csometimes contradictory mandate\u201d where you have to both be \u201cthe voice of the voiceless\u201d, and also engage with sometime unsympathetic Member States on the highest diplomatic level to provide guidance, expertise, and bolster monitoring and reporting.\u00a0\u00a0And she\u2019s got plenty of advice to pass on to her successor, once they are chosen, she tells us.\u00a0Michelle Bachelet:\u00a0Well, I will have to answer again what I told you four years ago.\u00a0It's a task that never ends, so probably there's a lot of things we were not able to do or to achieve. With the civil society, with other agencies, we have had some important steps. Like, for example, the decision of the General Assembly, that there is a human right \u2013\u00a0a right to a healthy environment\u00a0- and the fight against pollution, and so on.\nI believe that\u00a0the worst threat for humanity is what we call the triple planetary crisis; climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss.Michelle BacheletThis was a long-time fight from civil society, but afterwards, a very strong partnership between us and WHO, pushing for that. And then there was the Human Rights Council resolution, that then went to the General Assembly and was also, I would say, approved by a big majority or a strong majority. So, I think that was really important.I believe that\u00a0the worst threat for humanity is what we call the triple planetary crisis; climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss. So, if the Member States walk the talk, I think it will be a really important step.But we also got some other things. I would say we have seen certain trends towards\u00a0abolition of the death penalty. Over 170 countries either have abolished already, or have established a moratorium\u00a0on the death penalty and more countries have announced that they're going to go in the same direction. That I think is very good news as well.In some places we have been able to support people, so their voices are being heard, so laws have been changed - for the better, if I may say, in terms of protecting and promoting human rights, women's rights or children's rights.Also, I will say that we have been working towards the protection of human rights defenders.It's\u00a0always a job that has to have big goals and medium ones and smaller ones, because you have to do so many different things. So, we'll need to continue working.\u00a0If any High Commissioner said everything's done, I would say hello, no, that's not reality.\u00a0Michelle\u00a0Bachelet:\u00a0Well, you're right, the world has changed dramatically I would say over the four years. Of course, you mentioned already the pandemic, and increasingly strong impact of climate change. And now we're seeing the reverberating shocks of the food, fuel and finance crisis as a consequence of the war in Ukraine.We have seen also huge polarization on the international level, and also we have seen protest movements and coups d\u2019\u00e9tats in Myanmar and Burkina Faso and Guinea and Mali, and also the takeover of the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nI would say\u00a0it's a constant and permanent struggle\u00a0to not only be aware, but to call on Member States to continue (with their) responsibility that is to protect and promote, and also to support civil society so they can do their part as well.Michelle BacheletAnd so I would say this is not something that goes only in one direction, because on one side,\u00a0yes, you can see a lot of things that are going in the wrong direction and they're not helping human rights.We cannot take it for granted because nobody thought a new war could come in Europe, and we have one, and we thought that human rights was a given, and it\u2019s not.And we saw that countries who always speak about human rights, (do) not necessarily always respect them.I would say\u00a0it's a constant and permanent struggle\u00a0to not only be aware, but to call on Member States to continue (with their) responsibility that is to protect and promote, and also to support civil society so they can do their part as well. (We) have seen so many important movements, young people demonstrating for the planet, women, the Me Too campaign\u2026Or, Black Lives Matter and all the demonstrations in favour of stopping systemic racism, and so on. So, I would say\u00a0there has been (a) reverse in some areas, but on the other hand, there have been important step in others. So as always in life, you have good moments and difficult moments, and you have to work with both.Michelle Bachelet:\u00a0Well, I mean there are different kinds of things. Sometimes\u00a0you have to deal with terrible individual cases that really touch you very much. But on the other hand, when you go into a place and you see the pain of the people - I just came back from Cox\u2019s Bazar talking to Rohingyas and seeing they\u2019re asking us, the UN, to ensure that they can go back to Myanmar. And we\u2019re not able right now to ensure, because the right conditions are not there so they can go in in a safe manner.But on the other hand, you see people there full of energy and enthusiastic, and willing to go back to their country. One of the issues that was very difficult, not only in the world but also in the office (OHCHR) was the COVID-19 pandemic because it meant that everything was changed.We had to learn to adapt to the new situation, to live in different circumstances. The shutdown, the quarantines, were really complicated for many people, for our colleagues as well, with little children and so on. And on the other hand, we had to deal with the lack of equalities in terms of access to vaccines, access to treatment.Looking again\u00a0how COVID-19 laid bare all the inequalities in the world are, that made it for me so clear, that after we are able to recover from the pandemic, our goal was not to go back to normality, because that normality was very bad.\u00a0That normality brought us to that (point), but also gave us the possibility of discussing, OK, what do we want for the future? So that's why\u00a0we started talking about \u201cbuild back better\u201d but now we are changing that to \u201cbuild forward better\u201d, if I may say. So, always something that is a problem, can bring opportunities.\u00a0Michelle Bachelet: Well, first of all, I am a UN Under-Secretary-General, so every time I speak, I speak (as the) High Commission of Human Rights of the UN, so\u00a0I'm always independent to say what I think I have to say. But I don't speak as a person, I speak as the UN.I've always felt free in terms of saying what I thought should be said, or what I thought that was important.I always try to identify what's the best in every single situation, because not every situation is the same.\u00a0Sometimes you have no other choice than to speak, and very strongly. In some others you can feel that maybe you can use different strategies, and but\u00a0I have never felt that somebody imposed (on) me to be silent. I always felt free to say, or not to say, what I thought it was necessary to do.Michelle Bachelet:\u00a0Well, I think first of all, I have to say, this was the first trip of a High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 17 years and I had the opportunity to meet with national authorities, regional authorities and local authorities - provincial authorities - and\u00a0I was able to convey all the messages that I thought it was important for them to hear from a High Commissioner of Human Rights, and to make our observations on what things should change and how everything - I would say law and policy - should be in compliance with international human rights law, and I was able to freely say all that I thought needed to be discussed with them.It\u2019s important with everyone, that I need to have a dialogue and a relation and engage all Member States and all stakeholders, and I always think sometimes dialogue can produce good results, sometimes not.I don\u2019t change it if it\u2019s China or the UK or US, or a developing country, we have defined with them certain follow-ups; how (to) work in the future with OHCHR with them in terms of analysing certain laws that we feel are not in compliance with human rights laws, but also in terms of discussing issues like minority and human rights; ethnic groups and human rights; freedom of religion and human rights; business and human rights.\u00a0Michelle Bachelet:\u00a0We continue working on all of these issues, but\u00a0I would like the international community not to forget about those situations, and sometimes because so many things are on the agenda and some things take more relevance in the media politically speaking, some of them particularly on the protracted conflict, I feel they're forgotten, and people are feeling abandoned by the international community. For example, we see in Yemen that despite the truce there are violations.And so we think that the ceasefire is a good thing, but we need now political dialogue, political process and ensure protection of civilians. So I think the reduction of hostility has improved the capacity of humanitarian actors to support there.On the Sahel, for example, during my visit to Burkina Faso, I saw in Burkina, Niger, Mali, there are so many intersecting crises over there. And I think it's important the international community step up its support for that.\nMy advice would be, to\u00a0be open, to engage with all Member States with stakeholders, to explain why it's so difficult, this position, because it asks you to be the voice of the voiceless.Michelle BacheletMichelle Bachelet:\u00a0Well, I hope I will have a personal conversation with him or her, whoever is chosen. And yes, my advice would be, first of all, I want to share my experiences, things that many times you don't know before you arrive in this position - that I can offer lessons learned.And my advice would be, to\u00a0be open, to engage with all Member States with stakeholders, to explain why it's so difficult, this position, because it asks you to be the voice of the voiceless. But on the other hand, it asks you to engage with Member States, give technical assistance, capacity building, but also monitoring and reporting. So\u00a0it's a pretty sometimes contradictory mandate, that makes it not always easy, but there are ways to deal with it\u00a0and to navigate that. So, I want to give them particular advice, regarding each of those points.In August, Michelle Bachelet, twice-elected President of Chile and the first head of UN Women, was confirmed as the new UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, replacing Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein.",

These include primarily shelter items, but also, \u201ccooking stoves, blankets, solar lamps.\u201d\u201cSo far,\u00a0we've delivered $1.5 million worth of aid, but much, much more will be needed in the coming weeks and also over the medium term, including development assistance,\u201d Mr. Saltmarsh said.\ud83d\udce2 #PakistanFloods update\ud83d\udce2WFP assistance to include food relief, malnutrition prevention and livelihoods support. WFP will also give logistics support for the response. But US$ 34 million is urgently needed to ramp up relief operations.\ud83d\udd17Get the full updatePakistan has endured severe monsoon weather since June, which saw rainfall levels 67 per cent above normal in that month alone, OCHA said in a statement. As of 27 August, rainfall in the country has been equivalent to\u00a02.9 times the national 30-year average.To date, 72 districts across Pakistan have been declared \u201ccalamity-hit\u201d by the government. Amid ongoing rains, the number of calamity-declared districts is expected to increase.\u201cWhen we hear flooding, we very often just think about people drowning, but it's so much more to it,\u201d said Christian Lindmeier, World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson. \u201cYou have\u00a0crush injuries from the debris floating in the water. You have electrical shocks from wires\u2026 you have the lack of drinking water,\u201d which is \u201cnot only a problem for the immediate situation, but for the medium situation as well\u201d.The WHO spokesperson also warned that \u201cat least 888 health facilities have been severely affected\u2026180 of which are completely damaged at this point\u201d.According to the\u00a0Global Climate Risk Index 2021 and Climate Watch, Pakistan is among the 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events, despite its very low carbon footprint.According to Clare Nullis, World Meteorological Organization (WMO) spokesperson, the deadly flooding is \u201cthe footprint of climate change where it is becoming more extreme\u201d. In\u00a0March and April,\u00a0Pakistan \u201cwas in the grips of this devastating heat wave and drought\u201d and now \u201cthe pendulum has swung\u201d, she warned.The World Food Programme (WFP) is supporting Pakistan as the country takes stock of floods which have reportedly killed more than 1,000 people and displaced some 33 million, the UN agency said on Monday.",

He urges the Biden administration to strengthen efforts to protect all LGBT people living in the United States.\ud83d\udc49https://t.co/v9r7h5GBmh@free_equal pic.twitter.com/8ruTbodpAMMr. Madrigal-Borloz presented his conclusions following a10-day visit to Washington DC, Birmingham, Alabama; Miami, Florida; and San Diego, California.While there, according to a press release issued by human rights office, OHCHR, \u00a0he met officials from each state, members of civil society, and others who shared their experiences.He said those in the LGBT community, particularly persons of colour, continue to face significant inequality in relation to health, education, employment, and housing, as well as being disproportionately impacted by violence.\u00a0Although significant measures have been adopted by the Biden administration to address these challenges, they remain \u201cunder a concerted attack.\u201d\u201cI am deeply alarmed by a widespread, profoundly negative riptide created by deliberate actions to roll back the human rights of LGBT people at state level,\u201d he said, noting that these include deeply discriminatory measures seeking to rebuild stigma against lesbian and gay persons, limiting comprehensive sexual and gender education for all, and access to gender-affirming treatment, sports and single-sex facilities for trans and gender diverse persons.\u201cThe evidence shows that, without exception, these actions rely on prejudiced and stigmatising views of LGBT persons, in particular transgender children and youth, and seek to leverage their lives as props for political profit\u201d, the independent expert said.Mr. Madrigal-Borloz also met authorities at a detention centre holding asylum seekers and the entry port of San Ysidro in the border with Mexico, expressing concern that LGBT asylum seekers and refugees \u201ccontinue to suffer the consequences of discriminatory frameworks adopted by the previous administration and not yet dismantled\u201d, according to the press release.He noted the US had played a central role in the design and adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \u201cwhich has provided a compass toward a world in which all persons see their dignity respected and live free and equal.\u201d\u201cThe Biden-Harris administration has adopted powerful and meaningful actions that are in conformity with international human rights law, reveal a thoughtful strategy created through participative approaches, and provide significant capacity for their implementation. This is exactly the combination of values, knowledge, and muscle that can drive social change.\u201cIn light of a concerted attack to undermine these actions, I exhort the administration to redouble its efforts to support the human rights of all LGBT persons living under its jurisdiction, and helping them to safe waters,\u2019\u2019 he said.\u00a0Special Rapporteurs and independent experts are appointed by the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council to examine and report back on a specific human rights theme or a country situation. The positions are honorary and the experts are not paid for their work.The UN agency working to end the AIDS pandemic, UNAIDS, on Tuesday welcomed a ruling in the St. Kitts and Nevis High Court that laws criminalizing gay sex are unconstitutional.The landmark decision means that the laws have immediately been struck from the Caribbean islands\u2019 legal code, which remained in place following independence from the United Kingdom in 1983.The Court upheld the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Sections 56 and 57 of the Offences Against the Person Act, violated the right to privacy and freedom of expression.\u201cThis landmark ruling is an important step forward in ensuring equality and dignity for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community in St. Kitts and Nevis and the whole Caribbean,\u201d said Luisa Cabal, UNAIDS Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean.\u201cToday, St. Kitts and Nevis joins a growing list of Caribbean nations that have overturned these colonial-era laws that deny people\u2019s human rights and hold back the response to the HIV pandemic. Everyone benefits from decriminalisation.\u201dLaws that punish consensual same sex relations, in addition to contravening the human rights of LGBT people, are a significant obstacle to improving health outcomes, including in the HIV response, said UNAIDS.Such laws simply sustain stigma and discrimination against LGBT people and are barriers to LGBT people seeking and receiving healthcare for fear of being punished or detained.Decriminalisation saves and changes lives, the agency noted in a press release.The UN human rights chief on Monday\u00a0welcomed the announcement\u00a0from the Prime Minister of Singapore, that the city State would move to repeal a law known as 377A, which for decades has criminalized sex between men.Some 69 States around the world currently criminalise homosexual relations between consenting adults. This means that in just this one area of human rights violations, two billion people are being discriminated against on a daily basis \u2013 a third of the world's population.",

Countries must cooperate in good faith with the UN and grant its officials the privileges and immunities necessary for them to independently exercise their functions.\u00a0This includes exempting UN officials from immigration restrictions and dealing with their visa applications as speedily as possible.\u00a0\u201cIsrael\u2019s failure to process visa applications that are necessary for my staff\u2019s access is inconsistent with these standards, and I call on the Government to meet its international obligations in this regard,\u201d she said.\u00a0Referring to the current context, the human rights chief noted that a growing number of UN staff and mechanisms, non-governmental organisations, and others are being expelled or refused entry.\u00a0\u201cIsrael\u2019s treatment of our staff is part of a wider and worrying trend to block human rights access to the occupied Palestinian territory,\u201d she said. \u201cThis raises the question of what exactly the Israeli authorities are trying to hide.\u201d\u00a0Last year, Israeli Forces killed 320 Palestinians, a ten-fold increase over 2020, she reported. \u00a0Troops also injured 17,042 people, or six times the 2020 figure. \u00a0Furthermore, the UN recorded the highest number of incidents of settler violence since recording began in 2017, while arrests of Palestinians doubled. So far this year, Israeli forces have killed at least 111 more Palestinians.\u00a0Ms. Bachelet said despite the visa refusals, the Palestine Office is delivering on its mandated work in monitoring Israel\u2019s compliance with its international human rights obligations and providing technical assistance. \u00a0\u201cWe publicly report on violations by Israel, but also on violations by the State of Palestine, by Hamas in Gaza and Palestinian armed groups. We also provide the principal support to the Palestinian Government to help it improve its compliance with international human rights obligations,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cWe will continue to deliver on our mandate. And we will continue to demand access to the occupied Palestinian territory for our staff, in line with Israel\u2019s obligations as a UN Member State.\u201d \u00a0Although it is back-to-school time for some 1.3 million Palestinian boys and girls, they face challenges \"many children across the world cannot imagine\", a senior UN official said on Tuesday.\u00a0Lynn Hastings, UN Resident Humanitarian Coordinator in the occupied Palestinian territory, detailed how violence, violations, demolitions, and deprivation have had an impact on young lives in the West Bank and Gaza.\u00a0\u201cPalestinian children hold in their hands the potential and drive to reimagine education, co-create new pathways for development, and transform their lives. They are tomorrow\u2019s leaders. We must do more to protect and support them, as children must not be exposed to violence or exploited for any purpose,\u201d she said.\u00a0Ms. Hastings reported that 20 children have been killed in the West Bank since the beginning of the year, compared to 12 during the same period in 2021.\u00a0Additionally, there are 56 outstanding demolition orders against schools where at least 6,400 children are taught in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\u00a0The UN has recorded 115 education-related violations in the first half of this year, which include direct or indirect firing of tear gas, stun grenades, and/or rubber-coated bullets, intimidating military and settler presences at schools, detentions, and movement restrictions preventing students from reaching their classes. \u00a0Overall, nearly 8,000 students have been impacted, increasing the risk they will drop out of school.\u00a0Seventeen children were killed during the latest escalation in Gaza, and schools are overcrowded, with 65 per cent operating on double shifts. \u00a0Ms. Hastings added that the conditions in Gaza for children, including having lived through four escalations in hostilities during their lifetime, increase the need for specialized psychosocial support services.\u00a0Despite the many challenges, she pointed to bright spots. \u00a0The youth literacy rate among Palestinians is over 99 per cent, and nearly 94 per cent of children graduating from primary school go on to a secondary education. \u00a0\u201cThe United Nations wishes all children a successful and fun-filled year where their fundamental right to education is protected and realized by all. We remain committed to protect children from violence and support them to fulfill their potential,\u201d she said.\u00a0Managing the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis is no substitute for a real political process, a truth laid bare by recent events, the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process told the Security Council on Thursday, as he urged delegates to turn their attention to the broader strategy of ending the occupation and realizing the long elusive two-State solution.",

Tuesday's International Day of Victims of Enforced Disappearances is an opportunity to show solidarity with the victims and their families. https://t.co/2EtdNeNOsU pic.twitter.com/aPz1vjCMUCThe Committee and Working Group on Enforced Disappearances \u2013 the UN\u2019s key mechanisms to address this matter \u2013 receive new cases daily.The\u00a0International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance\u00a0entered into force back in 2010, affirming the right of any victim to know the truth about the circumstances of an enforced disappearance, as well as the fate of the disappeared person.Having been taken outside the reach of the law, and \"disappeared\" from society, victims are in fact deprived of all their rights.Some of the human rights that enforced disappearances regularly violate, include the right to liberty and security of the person, and the right to an identity.Furthermore, enforced disappearance is considered more than a human rights violation, and has frequently been used as a strategy to spread terror across communities.Becoming a global problem \u2013 and not restricted to a specific region of the world \u2013 it can nowadays be perpetrated in complex situations of internal conflict, especially as means of political repression of opponents.Hundreds of thousands of people have vanished during conflicts\u00a0or periods of repression in at least 85 countries around the world.More than a human rights violation against an individual, enforced disappearances have frequently been used as a strategy to spread terror within the whole of society, the United Nations said on Sunday, the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearance.",

    "maintext": "SubscribeAudio Hub31 August marks the International Day for People of African Descent, on which the UN calls for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against persons who fit this description. Ahead of the Day, UN News spoke to Dominique Day, and Verene Shepherd, two experts on the subject, who want to raise awareness about the links between the Transatlantic Slave Trade and the global economy.Dominique Day is a human rights lawyer, and the chairperson of the\u00a0UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent. Verene Shepherd is a social historian, and the chairperson of the\u00a0UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD).The rights experts sat down with UN News, to talk about their experiences of racism, and why there needs to be a wider acceptance that today\u2019s global economy was built on the oppression of Black people.UN News Dominique, you say that \u201ceveryday racism is normalized\u201d. What do you mean by that?Dominique Day The idea that I can't always get a taxi in New York City, the lengths my parents went to, to make sure that I was super educated, to be able to counter the ways I might be misinterpreted or mischaracterized by a world that sees my skin and comes to a different interpretation than who I actually am.UN News So you internalize it and you and you just say this is life, that's how it is?Dominique Day Well, not so much \u201cthat's how it is\u201d, but to actually confront every episode of everyday racism you experience from teachers, judges, police, regular society, even people your friends. The idea that casual racism is so normalized in our society means that, for us to survive it, we actually need to be very thoughtful about the ways we engage. For those of us who work on racism, we have an opportunity to do advocacy and awareness raising. For example, on a country visit, I will talk about racism I may have experienced in that same country, but may not have confronted as directly because my sanity, my equilibrium matters.This everyday casual racism has actually been so interwoven into our society, we not only fail to see it, but there's a really active culture of denial that operates transnationally.UN News Are you seeing acceptance of the idea that there could be some form of reparations?Dominique Day I think that, like any other topic, talking about it helps. Uplifting examples help. New arguments are being brought forward by people operating in a number of professional spaces. So, the discourse is evolving.UN News The Transatlantic Slave Trade is referenced in the Secretary General's remarks on the Website for the International Day for People of African Descent. Are you surprised the Transatlantic Slave Trade is still such a live issue, particularly in the United States?Verene Shepherd Let me just say that I am happy that it is.The Mayor of London takes it seriously: I recently gave a lecture there on the subject, my fifth, at City Hall, which was very well attended.But the first thing that confronted me was that I was finger-printed as I came through immigration, as if I\u2019m a criminal. I really was shattered. But then I said to myself, there are people who need to hear what I have to say tonight, and so, oppressors are not going to stop me from doing what I have to do. It was sobering because it said to me, no black person is exempt from racism and from racial profiling, and I think we have to be realistic about that. UN News In the US we\u2019re seeing a backlash to Critical Race Theory\u2026Dominique Day It is a threat to white supremacy, a threat to the privilege and power that people have been able to accrue by commodifying their whiteness as value. We even see this in international development work.Critical Race Theory says, let\u2019s look at what has created the world we're living in today, let's take a critical view of history. It actually shouldn't be a threat. We're trying to offer a rigorous and honest look at the world as it exists today, and when we talk about things like the Slave Trade, we're talking about a moment in history, a moment in global history where transnational relationships were being developed, where the market economy and credit economy were being birthed. And all of these fancy economic terms we use today were being developed using black bodies as collateral, as subjects of trade, both in the financial and agricultural markets.UN News Is it correct to say, then, that the current global economy, the way it is now, is built on the oppression of black people?Dominique Day That is fair to say, look at the flight paths: if you ever travel in Africa, you'll be traveling on British Airways if you're going to former British colonies. You'll be traveling on Air France if you're going to former French colonies. Who owns the diamonds in South Africa? These are the legacy of a colonial relationships continue to govern not only global wealth, but geopolitical power.I'm not suggesting that racial justice work will upset that, but perhaps the awareness of that can motivate activities to actually right what's been wrong, Verene Shepherd The reparation movement, which is escalating, in my view, is uncovering the facts that people try to hide. I think this is a threat, and this is why there is backlash form those who are seeing the real possibility that this is going somewhere.They think that it's better to have a generation of people who don't know about this stuff. Then we don't have to feel guilty about the past.And speaking about the Caribbean region, there is shame about the past, which too often fills the place that should be held by knowledge.We need to break the bonds of shame that some people feel about the past, and use knowledge as liberation.UN News What should people who have benefited from this historic oppression do? Verene Shepherd I don't think reparation reparatory justice is only something that will satisfy the victims and those who are continuing to suffer the legacies. If we all engage truly and honestly in the reparatory justice conversation, including those who live in Europe, in the belly of the spaces that oppress other people, I think it will be liberating for everybody.If you live in a privileged society, if you live in a in a former colonial power and you compare the social infrastructure in that country to the social infrastructure in the South, and when you connect the dots, you realize that you are benefiting from the legacies of the suffering of my ancestors, that's just how it is.You can't say it has nothing to do with me, whilst benefiting from a good education system, a good health system, good infrastructure. Some benefited from the inheritance, and other people, who got nothing at the time of emancipation or independence, continue to try to make do with little.That is why we see so many universities and religious institutions in Britain studying their role, and how they benefited from the transatlantic trafficking in enslaved Africans. Dominique Day We need to acknowledge the moral wound that racism has inflicted across our society, to the point that we can't even acknowledge that we walk with racism as an everyday thing. We are all educated into it. We get benefits for reinforcing it, and it's also tacitly reinforced in our media and our education and in our intimate lives. That reality is something we need to confront.The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination opened in Geneva on Monday to review anti-discrimination efforts being done in seven UN Member States.Following the killings of at least 23 Brazilians during police raids and checks, UN-appointed independent human rights experts called on Wednesday for urgent reforms against \u201cracialized police brutality\u201d.",

    "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubAfter successfully reclaiming her people\u2019s territory in Northern Argentina, Celestina \u00c1balos turned to tourism to share and promote her indigenous culture. \u00a0UN entrepreneurship training during the COVID-19 pandemic helped her business to grow.Indigenous entrepreneur Celestina \u00c1balos runs a tourism business in the UNESCO World Heritage site of Quebrada de Humahuaca in Jujuy province, northern Argentina, sharing her community\u2019s culture and knowledge of medicinal herbs.\u201cI am a child of Pachamama, Mother Earth. Earth is everything to us. It is life. We cannot conceive of ourselves without her. My community dates back 14,000 years. On behalf of 60 families, I led a 20-year fight for the right to land, education and freedom.We used to live under a rental system where we had a landlord who delineated the spaces for us to occupy and to live in, both for sowing crops and raising cattle. \u00a0It was a life very much governed by what the master said, by the space you had to occupy, and by what I saw my parents having to pay at the end of each year. \u00a0These were very powerful moments for a teenager. \u00a0Through the process of reclaiming our territory I began to think more about how to make my history and the history of my people known. I have always seen, and I continue to see in the media, the stigma that is placed on us indigenous peoples. \u00a0 I wanted to show and make the other side of the story known. \u00a0That motivated me but I was thinking: \"How do I do it, how do I show this?\"In 2003, our mountain valley, the Quebrada de Humahuaca, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. This marked a milestone in the history of our people. I saw that many people were talking about our mountains, our culture, our food. \u00a0And I said to myself: \"but this is us: we know how to do it, we are the guardians of our culture\".Culture, for us, is part of our daily life, it is the knowledge and skills that have been transmitted from generation to generation. We learn it from the moment we are born. It\u2019s in our medicinal herbs and in our food, in our crops.\nSo I thought, \"Why not dare to do what I know, what I have learned?\" That is how my tourism business, a tea house called the Casa de Celestina, was born.When tourists come to the Casa de Celestina, I welcome them, I introduce them to the use of medicinal herbs, such as mate, which we drink in the morning and in the afternoon to energize ourselves. I talk about which herb we take when we are sick, when to harvest it, how to dry it, how to preserve them.\u00a0I talk about our diet. We have our different corns here and we make our own flour, so we have flour for soup, flour for tamales, flour to make cookies, flour to make our juices, our drinks, flour to make our pastriesAll that knowledge is there because it has been transmitted from generation to generation. Our mothers, our grandmothers, for me, are the real treasure troves of biodiversity. Our grandparents are those living libraries in our communities. Without them and without that knowledge, I could not be speaking today.\u00a0I have learned, by observing, watching, sharing. You have to be contributing to the land, putting wood on the fire, lighting an oven and making your offering. You have to be there at sunset, when the goats are already back in the corral and the grandparents are sitting down.The tourists prepare a dish with me. It can be a culli corn flour pudding, with nuts, with chocolate chips. Or they can also prepare a delicious meal, quinoa croquettes stuffed with goats cheese, with saut\u00e9ed potatoes, rosemary and herbs. Or we can also prepare a llama casserole.Then we visit my town and our church, which dates back to 1789. We visit the path of herbs, where they also learn about other medicinal herbs such as Muna-Muna, which is for bruises, for muscle pains.\u00a0They get to know our stories, our ceremonies, like the dispatch of souls or the story of how we reclaimed our territory. I share what my day is like and what I do. And then we go down and we drink tea together and eat the pudding they have prepared.\u00a0I renew their energies with the herbs that we have also brought from the path. They leave feeling renewed, they leave with a different view of us. They experience a living culture, the essence of culture.That is what I like about tourism, about those who come to visit us. You see how this relationship of culture goes beyond sharing an experience. It is about looking at each other in a different way, to look at each other as human beings.The pandemic hit my business very hard. \u00a0The reservations I had were cancelled. The little savings I had went to feeding my family. \u00a0I felt so impotent. \u00a0The government said that there were subsidies for entrepreneurs, but I did not qualify and had to continue to pay taxes. \u00a0Many small business entrepreneurs have had a very difficult time. \u00a0It was very hard.I was invited to take part in a virtual Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) course, run by the International Labour Organization (ILO), that was going to take place between October and November 2021. I was very interested in improving my entrepreneurship and developing a business plan because it was one of the reasons why I could not access loans and subsidies. So, I said yes right away. \u00a0The ILO course provided me with tools to scale up my business. I am still using them today. They included how to make a business plan, estimate costs, prepare a budget and inventory and manage social media. Some of the people on the course had already started their own businesses, others were about to start. It was a chance to share and exchange our experiences. What I liked the most were the course manuals. They are very, very useful, very good.My business is steadily improving. I am achieving my dream. \u00a0I still remember a speech that I gave a long time ago to Argentina\u2019s then President N\u00e9stor Kirchner. I told him: \"We, the indigenous peoples, want an opportunity, the opportunity for development, the opportunity to improve our quality of life.\"It is important for my community to see that it is possible, that we women can carry out our businesses with the tools we have. We do not have to wait until we have everything, but we can start with what we have now.\"Dekha Dewandana ran a thriving \u2018homestay\u2019 tourism property in Bali, and received UN-supported training which has helped him to maintain a high standard of hospitality. When COVID-19 hit Indonesia, his business was pushed to the verge of collapse and, after a bruising two-year period, it\u2019s now slowly recovering.",

    "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubSix months after the Russian invasion, Ukraine is the scene of the largest humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War. Almost a third of those displaced by the conflict come from the region around the country\u2019s second largest city of Kharkiv, in the east. Helping those in need is dangerous work.Before dawn on 24 February, Kharkiv took a fierce hit. Within 24 hours, Russian troops had reached the northern suburbs, just 30 kilometres from the Ukraine-Russia border. Despite outnumbering the Ukrainian forces, the invading army was unable to enter the city.\u201cI am from Kharkiv, from the largest residential area in Ukraine \u2013 Saltivka, where about 400,000 people lived before the war,\u201d says 21-year-old Tania, who has found a temporary home in Ivano-Frankivsk Region and participated in a Summer school run by the UN migration agency (IOM), for young leaders among displaced persons and members of hosted communities.\u00a0\u201cFor two weeks, my family and I did not leave the underground metro station, even for a minute. The metro became the main bomb shelter for the locals. I did not want to leave the city, because my grandparents remained behind. \u00a0But when they came to us in Kharkiv, I decided to flee from the war.\u201d\u00a0According to a recent IOM survey, around 28 per cent of the estimated 6.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine fled from the Kharkiv Region. The humanitarian needs of those who chose to stay, or were unable to flee, are immense.In May, the city received the first humanitarian convoy from IOM with much-needed items for people staying in shelters and hospitals, as well as hard-to-reach communities in areas under Ukrainian control.\u201cLocals need solar lamps as there is no light, mattresses and blankets as it is damp and cold in shelters, tools for minor repairs for their damaged houses, and hygiene kits,\u201d explains Serhii, the head of Source of Revival, one of the biggest non-governmental organizations in the region and IOM\u2019s implementing partner in the Kharkiv Region.In the first months of the war, the Source of Revival team\u2019s working day began at 6am and ended at 3pm, when a curfew was set and any movement around the city was forbidden. The location of the warehouses had to be changed several times due to heavy shelling, missiles, and air strikes.\u00a0Not all drivers agreed to go to this dangerous area. The situation has since escalated, the number of casualties is growing, but no one in the team has left Kharkiv. They put on bulletproof vests and protective helmets to deliver IOM\u2019s assistance to those in dire need.Nadia, who is currently living on the outskirts of Kharkiv, fled her home in the city of Derhachi due to heavy shelling shortly after discovering she was pregnant in March.\u201cNow, there is nothing left alive in Derhachi,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThere is also shelling here, but not as fierce as in my hometown; then, when a missile hit a nearby school, we moved once again.\u201d\u00a0Source of Revival brought tailored humanitarian aid from IOM directly to her temporary home as it was especially challenging for a pregnant woman to move around the unsafe city.The hardest part of the team\u2019s work is delivering aid to communities that survived the Russian occupation. Although it takes time to de-mine the area after Ukrainian forces recovered it, NGOs endeavour to reach people in critical need as quickly as possible.\u00a0\u201cSome settlements were razed to the ground. There are many local Irpins and Buchas in our region\u201d, a Source of Revival staff says, referring to two cities in Kyiv oblast occupied by Russia at the start of the war where evidence points to significant human rights abuses being committed against the civilians. Exploitation, kidnapping for ransom, robbery, bullying, torture, rape, and sexual abuse of women, children, the elderly, and men.Humanitarian workers are helping local residents and identifying victims of conflict-related violence. All of them can go to the IOM centre for physical and psychosocial rehabilitation.Lately, Kharkiv has been receiving increasing numbers of displaced persons fleeing neighbouring Donetsk and Luhansk regions. And, despite the security situation, even Kharkiv residents are returning to their homes with high hopes.\u201cThey want to rebuild this place, but everything has changed\u201d, says Serhii, whose house was damaged by shelling. \u201cThe infrastructure is damaged, houses are destroyed, there is no work, and part of the region is still occupied. Russian troops are trying to move closer to the city, so the threat remains, and chaotic shelling continues.\u201d\u00a0According to authorities, over 1,000 civilians in Kharkiv Region were killed in the last 181 days, including 50 children, and this figure may rise. Calm is deceptive here, and the situation can change in the blink of an eye.In one single night, on 18 August, 21 civilians died, and 44 were injured as a result of a missile attack on a residential area. Nevertheless, as was the case 79 years ago, locals believe in their land and justice, revealing the same strength and character as their ancestors.\u201cI draw power from my team. I understand that most of them could leave Kharkiv, but they stayed. They are the first to put on vests, helmets and go to help others,\u201d says Serhii.The UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR)\u00a0expressed concern\u00a0on Tuesday after photos and videos released on social media appeared to show metal cages being built in the philharmonic hall in the devastated Ukrainian city of Mariupol, apparently to house prisoners of war (POWs) during an upcoming \u201cshow trial\u201d. \u00a0Nearly 1,000 boys and girls have been killed or injured in the war in Ukraine, the head of the UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) reported on Monday, underscoring the urgent need for peace.\u00a0",

Amrita Bhagwandin was at her home in the New York Borough of Queens on that traumatic day.\u201cI emigrated from Guyana in 1998 and have lived in Queens ever since. I live with my husband and my daughter. We are a small family but have many relations in New York and New Jersey.\u00a0The community here is very diverse, from Guyanese, Trinidadians and Bengalis, to Indians, Chinese, and Filipinos. We are a very happy bunch of hard-working people. We plant gardens, we send our kids to colleges, and do all kinds of things to give back to the community.On 1 September, when Ida hit, I was working from home. I switched on the television to get the alerts; it was clear a storm was brewing. I focused on the radar and followed the storm on the map. It looked like it was going to come through the northeast. When I saw how much red there was, I knew it was definitely going to affect us.Some improvements had been made on the storm sewers on our block in the previous year, so I was hopeful that we would not feel the impacts too hard. But as the afternoon approached, I saw how many hours of rain they were forecasting. I became very worried, and I started to warn the neighbours to be very careful that night.Usually, if there is a sign of flooding, I leave the house because I get panic attacks from the situation. So, I packed a bag and I said to them, let's leave. My husband and daughter initially wanted to stay and so my husband just dropped me off at my in-laws who live on higher ground just down the block.I kept calling both of them and around 10:00 pm I told them they needed to leave the house. Right after I called them, the sewer hole right in front of my house popped. They barely made it out and drove up the block to my sister in-laws.\u00a0We live on the corner of an intersection, and the water filled each side and went four directions. I was calling to make sure everyone was safe when I was told that someone was missing.\u00a0Eventually, I found out that the mother and her son living next door to me had both drowned and died in the basement.I don\u2019t have the words to tell you the pain that this neighbourhood has gone through since. I see that kid every single day. He was so young and vibrant, and so was the mother.\u00a0They lost their lives in a matter of seconds. There were even scuba divers trying to get them out, but it was to no avail.\u00a0These houses should not have been here, in this low-lying area. We have been sounding the alarm for a very, very long time.\u00a0I hope that in New York City, everyone is now consciously paying attention to what the weather is doing, so no more lives are senselessly lost. With the amount of rainfall we are seeing and the number of storms that are expected for this upcoming summer, we are frightened and scared.\u00a0I don't know what I'll do because the foundation of my house has still not been repaired, because it is so expensive.\u00a0It seems that the area is just too low for residential housing. The engineers of the Climate Resiliency Agency of New York City worked with us, and proposed a trial of lifting the houses. There are many different options, but the option is not to stay here as it is.Everyone on our block lives in constant fear. When I see rain on the radar, I want to escape. I have luggage packed so I can leave.\u00a0Ida is an experience we should learn from and not let happen again. Climate change is going to be there. Changes are going to happen all the time, and we have to equip ourselves for them.\u00a0I want to know what the future of this community is going to be. What is to happen? Will I sit and worry for the next people who come and live here? I want a safer community for everyone, for all of America, for every community.\u201d\n\u00a0As the North Atlantic hurricane season enters its traditional peak period, the US National\u202f Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (NOAA) has adjusted its forecast to monitor the conditions which impact cyclonic activity, according to the UN weather agency,\u00a0WMO, on Friday.\u202f\u00a0",

    "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubSri Lanka is in the midst of the worst socio-economic crisis in its history, and the once robust health-care system is nearing collapse, with patients at risk from power shortages, a lack of medicines, and equipment shortages.When Ruchika found out she was pregnant with her second child, in October 2021, she could not have imagined that she would find herself, hours before delivering her baby, in a crowded distribution queue, pleading for fuel to get to the hospital.\u201cThe majority of the crowd was sympathetic,\u201d Ruchika recalled. \u201cThe authorities allowed me to buy the fuel I needed after examining my medical documents to confirm my story, but there were still a few who were shouting at us.\u201dPregnant women in Sri Lanka find themselves in a world that was unimaginable just a few months ago. The crisis is critically undermining sexual and reproductive health services, including maternal health care and access to contraception, and services to prevent and respond to gender-based violence have also been compromised.Ruchika made it to the hospital the day after her harrowing wait for fuel, just in time to deliver her baby. But fuel was not her only concern.Two months before her due date, Ruchika heard that women were being asked to supply gloves, blades and other basic materials needed for safe childbirth when they visited the state hospital to deliver. \u00a0\u201cThe hospital had run out and had no way to replenish their stocks,\u201d Ruchika recalled.She was terrified. \u201cI immediately called my doctor and asked about the availability of materials and if I needed to make preparations as well. \u2018We have the material for now,\u2019 is what he told me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t give me any assurances about what the situation would be in two months for my delivery. I was worried about how bad things would get so I asked my doctor twice if my baby could be delivered safely even if it was two months early.\u201dThe doctor refused, citing risks to the baby\u2019s health. \u201cHe assured me that as long as I got to the hospital in time he would make sure we were both healthy \u2013 but even that was such a struggle.\u201dShe ended up not only worried about her own access to fuel, but also that of the hospital staff. \u201cThe week before my delivery, my husband asked about my doctor\u2019s fuel status because we\u2019d heard so many stories of doctors and nurses not being able to report to work because of the fuel crisis,\u201d she said.Ruchika\u2019s family continues to struggle. When her four-and-a-half-year-old daughter got sick, they had to go to six pharmacies to find the nebulizer she needed. And weeks after giving birth, Ruchika is well past the date she was due to get her stitches removed. She is waiting for her doctor to let her know when she can come in. Right now, the doctor is required to save the limited fuel he has to travel only when one of his other patients goes into active labour.\u00a0\u201cThe current economic crisis has far-reaching consequences for women and girls\u2019 health, rights and dignity,\u201d said Dr. Natalia Kanem, Executive Director of the UN sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA. \u201cRight now, our priority is to respond to their unique needs and safeguard their access to life-saving healthcare services and support.\u201dAn estimated 215,000 Sri Lankan women are currently pregnant, according to data from the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health, \u00a0including 11,000 adolescent girls, and around 145,000 women will deliver in the next six months.UNFPA is appealing for $10.7 million to urgently meet the sexual and reproductive health needs, and protection needs, of women and girls in Sri Lanka. This funding would go towards life-saving medicines, equipment and supplies, including supplies for the clinical management of rape and services for domestic violence survivors.It would also supply 10,000 delivery, maternity and dignity kits and provide more than 37,000 women with cash voucher assistance for reproductive health services, expand services for violence survivors, and support 1,250 midwives.Still, with infrastructure and transportation challenges, childbirth could remain a life-threatening prospect for those unable to access skilled medical care.\n\u00a0The UN sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA, is leading efforts to protect women and girls\u2019 rights to give birth safely and live without gender-based violence, according to a statement issued on Monday.",

    "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubA tiny Caribbean Island known as 'the flower of the ocean' was decimated by Hurricane Iota in 2020. Although the loss of human life was minimal, the impact on precious ecosystems deeply changed the perspective of its inhabitants. Two years later, they\u2019re still working to restore their environmental treasures and preparing for whatever curveballs climate change might throw at them next.The mountainous Colombian island of Providencia \u2013 which lies midway in the extension of the Caribbean Sea that separates Costa Rica and Jamaica \u2013 is home to stunning colours of the sea, lush underwater landscapes, extensive mangrove forests, and even tropical dry forests.The diversity of marine ecosystems and surrounding natural wonders, including the yearly spectacle of thousands of rare black crabs descending from the mountains and heading to the sea to lay their eggs, and one of the world\u2019s largest barrier reefs, which supports a stunning array of marine life, has led to its declaration as part of the Seaflower UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.However, as with all islands in the world, Providencia\u2019s unique natural treasures are highly threatened by climate change and sea level rise, threats that are not \u2018theories\u2019 looming on the horizon, but that are instead terrible facts already impacting every facet of life there.Its 6,000 inhabitants will never forget the night of November 16th, when Iota, the last and strongest hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic storm season\u2014 deemed then a Category 5* \u2014 decimated their beloved land.\u201cThe most shocking thing was the sound. Our people say that the hurricane came with the devil because the sound was so strange and scary,\u201d recalls Marcela Cano, a biologist and long-time resident who has made it her life\u2019s work to preserve Providencia\u2019s environmental treasures.But that night, she would spend hours fighting to survive the storm.She was at her home sleeping when at around midnight, she started hearing strange noises. This turned out to be wind gusts of over 155 miles an hour tearing across the island.Power and communication were shortly lost.\u201cI stood up and noticed that my ceiling lights looked as if they were higher than usual. That\u2019s when I realized that part of my roof had flown away,\u201d Ms. Cano recalls now, adding that minutes later she heard two loud bangs from her guestroom and saw water pouring down the walls.Her immediate reaction was to get out of the house, a decision that looking back now was definitely the best one, she says, because not only the roof but most of the walls of her house collapsed in the darkness under the force of the pounding rains and the wind.\u201cIt was raining very hard; I almost couldn\u2019t make it out of my house because the wind wouldn\u2019t let me open the door. I made it just where I had parked my Mula [her motorized golf cart]. I was completely soaked, and I just sat there.\u201dShe spent over 10 hours sitting in her golf cart hoping that the wall next to it and a big pine tree would hold up.\u201cEvery time I would hear loud bangs, I would point my flashlight towards the tree. If it had broken, that would\u2019ve been it for me.\u201dIt was the longest night Providencia had ever experienced. And even after sunrise, the hurricane let barely any light come through.\u201cVery strong wind gusts would come and go for hours and hours, and all I could think was \u2018please God make it stop, it\u2019s been too long, please stop\u2019. \u00a0It felt like the longest time of my life. At about 11 am it finally got a bit better, but it was still raining pretty hard.\u201dIt was then that she saw her neighbours up the road calling her. She gathered the courage to walk up the debris-strewn little hill towards them and realised their house had also been lost.But for Marcela, the loss was about to become even bigger and more painful.Ms. Cano is the Director of Old Providence McBean Lagoon Natural National Park, a unique and highly important protected site on the island and the Seaflower UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. \u00a0She has worked for over 30 years to protect it, and with her team, has been a pioneer in ecosystem restoration and ecotourism.\u201cI looked around and all the vegetation on the island was gone, everything was black, and all the trees no longer had leaves. It was as if everything had been burnt, and the sea was up high. I could see Santa Catalina Island from there; I couldn\u2019t see it before. And I could see how destroyed it was,\u201d she remembers, telling UN News that every time she tells this story she can barely hold back the tears.That night, she took refuge with 10 families under a concrete ledge that hadn\u2019t given an inch to the winds and the rain. It was actually the second floor of a house under construction.\u201cWe made a common makeshift bed. It was also the middle of a COVID-19 peak in Colombia, but no one could care about that at that moment,\u201d Ms. Cano says.It was still raining, and the island had been without communication for over eight hours. The whole mainland of Colombia wondered for almost a day if Providencia had survived hurricane Iota or not.In the following days, as help arrived, other locals described how people were walking around like \u201czombies\u201d searching for food and shelter. Miraculously, only four people lost their lives that night, but over 98 per cent of the island\u2019s infrastructure was destroyed and 6,000 people were left homeless.\u201cI went walking to ask about my team at the National Park. We were all fine, but we lost everything we had worked for. Our office, our library, the research data stored in our computers, everything was lost.\u201dSometime later, Ms. Cano was able to return to Providencia after spending time with her family in Bogot\u00e1 and working to gather household items and basic necessities for some families affected by the storm.It was then that she was able to evaluate the environmental damage inside the National Park.\u201cI\u2019ve spent most of my life here in Providencia and to see that all our efforts to maintain the National Park had vanished from one day to the next, was heartbreaking.\u201dAccording to Colombia\u2019s National Natural Parks, around 90 per cent of the Park\u2019s mangroves and forests were affected, as well as the coral reefs in shallow waters, many of which had been in nurseries as part of an ongoing restoration effort. \u00a0\u201cWe are working to restore vegetation and saline formations. We also carried out rescue and replanting of coral colonies that were uprooted by the hurricane,\u201d Ms. Cano explains while standing in what\u2019s left of the pier of Crab-Cay, once the most visited attraction in Providencia.The small island rises sharply and dramatically off the coast surrounded by turquoise waters. Tourists used to climb to the top for 360-degree views of the park. Now a new viewing deck and pier are being built, and some vegetation planted last year, has begun to sprout.\u201cWas this here before the hurricane?\u201d she asks her team, pointing to some algae-covered metal debris.Thanks to its field work and reef restoration experience over the past decade, McBean Lagoon National Park is currently the largest contributor to the nationwide project One Million Corals for Colombia to restore over 200 hectares of coral reef, with over 55,000 coral fragments in nurseries and over 6,000 transplanted.UN News visited some of the transplanted colonies and witnessed the miracle of coral fragments fusing together and attracting young fish, bringing life back to the sea currently threatened by warming seas and extreme weather events.\u201cThe water is getting warmer, so algae colonies are getting bigger and fighting coral reef for its resources,\u201d explains young Marine Biologist Violeta Posada, a member of Ms. Cano\u2019s team at the Park.She underscored that ecosystem restoration work is a daily effort, as the team must constantly clean the colonies of the algae and other dangers that might hinder their growth.Ms. Posada, born and raised in Providencia, has been able to witness the pay-off of the restoration efforts.\u201cMy dad also worked at this park. These new colonies that you see here were built with fragments that my own father planted in nurseries 12 years ago,\u201d she says, adding that as an islander, caring for the ecosystems is a responsibility.\u201cThey give us food, shelter and protection. They also attract tourists, which this island depends on,\u201d she emphasizes.But while corals are starting to thrive again and the dry forest has also seen recovery, the almost 60 hectares of mangroves that are impossible to miss while visiting Providencia represent a bigger trial for the community.\u201cWe have a big challenge specifically with the Red Mangrove, the one that grows by the coast. Over 95 per cent of this species died during the hurricane, and it does not regenerate naturally,\u201d describes Marcela Cano.According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), mangroves support rich biodiversity and provide a habitat for fish and shellfish, as well as a landing strip and nesting area for large numbers of birds. Their roots are also a refuge for reptiles and amphibians.Their ecosystem can capture up to five times more carbon than tropical forests and their soils are highly effective carbon sinks, making them important \u2018lungs\u2019 for our heating planet.Mangroves also act as a natural coastal defence against storm surges, tsunamis, sea level rise and erosion \u2013 something the inhabitants of Santa Catalina, a small island connected to the north of Providencia by a bridge, witnessed first-hand.\u201cThe mangroves along the coast of Santa Catalina Island saved the lives of this community during Iota. Without mangroves and their ecosystem services, there is going to be a decrease in fish and biodiversity [affecting livelihoods], and if we don\u2019t restore it, it also won\u2019t be around to protect us again,\u201d Ms. Cano underlines.In the same golf cart that saved her life during the hurricane, Marcela Cano drove the UN News team to the Park\u2019s Mangrove Nursery, where over 4,000 seedlings are growing.\u201cWe have red and black mangroves here. We go and find all the seeds we can and put them in water buckets. When they grow roots, we then put them in sandbags. After four to five months, we can transplant them to their natural habitat,\u201d she explains.The restoration does not come without challenges. Along with the general scarcity of red mangrove seeds, Ms. Cano says that two species of crabs like to eat the young plants, and some iguanas chew their leaves.\u201cSo, we have had to come up with creative ideas to protect them,\u201d she says, mentioning water bottles, and baskets as some of the makeshift solutions.\u00a0The National Park restoration strategy also involves the community, and the Park is teaching young children who live near the mangroves how to grow and care for these ecosystems.\u201cIt is going to take us about 10 years to be able to have the mangroves with the structure and function they had before the hurricane. These are long-term restoration processes, it is important for governments to understand this,\u201d the expert urges.The local population of the island comprises Raizals, descendants of African Slaves and British Sailors, who speak English Creole, although most speak Spanish as well. There is also a smaller population of \u201cmigrants\u201d from the mainland, who call Providencia their home.The local economy revolves around tourism and traditional fishing and hunting. Due to COVID-19 restrictions and the devastation wrought by the hurricane, the tourism sector has been sluggish for the past two years.It wasn\u2019t until mid-2022 that the island opened back to the public but, to this date, it still doesn\u2019t have the capacity to receive the average of 3,000 visitors monthly that flocked there in 2019.A few of the still-standing hotels and businesses have been able to continue functioning thanks to the arrival of Government officials, contractors and volunteers who have been participating in reconstruction efforts.Juanita Angel, co-owner of the hotel Caba\u00f1as de Agua Dulce, saw her family business destroyed by the hurricane.\u201cAt first, I thought, \u2018no one is going to put this back together\u2019. We were closed for a year [due to] the pandemic and had put in loan to repair the roofs. Every time I saw a roof tile flying during the hurricane all I could think was \u2018there goes our money, and our hope.\u2019\u201dMs. Angel says that no one on the island expected Iota to cause such devastation because they had all made it through other hurricanes.\u201cThat is why no one took this seriously, we never thought something like this could happen to us\u2026 We are such a small island, a dot in the map, but we need to be prepared for the future,\u201d she adds.According to experts on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), there are many ways in which climate adaptation can be undertaken in small islands, including reducing socioeconomic vulnerabilities, building adaptive capacity, enhancing disaster risk reduction, and building longer-term climate resilience.Recently, the UN Secretary-General described the Caribbean region as \u201cground zero for climate emergency,\u201d and called on developed countries to match climate action to the scale and urgency of the crisis.This would mean providing financial support to small islands so that they can build stronger adaptation capacity, and ultimately, reduce carbon emissions, one of the main culprits heating our planet and driving the climate changes that are making hurricanes more powerful and more frequent.One way to build resilience and adaptation is by investing in ecosystem restoration, Marcela Cano underscores.\u201cA healthy ecosystem is more resilient. We must guarantee this so that when disaster comes the ecosystems can keep offering the environmental goods and services that contribute to a better quality of life for our population,\u201d she explains.Ms. Cano reminds us as well that one of the most effective strategies to tackle climate change is the declaration of Marine Protected Areas.These areas provide reduced stress on ecosystems and species, allowing them to carry on the natural processes that mitigate climate impacts, such as carbon storage.For example, according to UNEP, protecting whales is a nature-based solution against climate change. Whales accumulate carbon in their bodies during their long lives, some of which stretch to 200 years. When they die, they sink to the bottom of the ocean, taking the carbon with them.\u201cWe need more of these protected areas, and we also need more resources to manage them well, always involving and giving value to the knowledge of the local community,\u201d she underscores.The McBean Lagoon National Park chief underlines that restoring and protecting the ecosystems in Providencia is not only a self-serving task, but it benefits the whole planet.\u201cWe thought that climate change was something that was happening in other places, but this hurricane created a common conscience, and we are working on mechanisms to be more prepared for the future because we know that the risk of extreme weather events is only going to grow.\u201dStanding on the deck of her recently rebuilt house as part of a Government programme that has built back most of the homes in the community, Ms. Cano recalled that before the hurricane, she could not so easily see the ocean.\u201cAll the tall trees were swept away, and now I get this beautiful view, but I am replanting those [trees] too. Just imagine how much we lost.\u201dShe wants to make sure that the world knows that rebuilding houses is just a start.\u201cWe also need to prepare our people for stronger events, and we have to include climate change in the development policy of our island so that we can prepare and adapt for what\u2019s coming.\u201dMcBean Lagoon National Park was awarded a Blue Park Award for its exceptional marine wildlife conservation during the recent UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon, Portugal.\u201cBefore the hurricane, I was about to retire, but now I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t just leave my post without making sure this Park is strong and ready for future generations,\u201d the biologist highlights, admitting that she once thought she would never spend another November in Providencia, and with the 2022 peak hurricane season looming, the frightening memories of Iota are slipping back.Ecosystems support all life on Earth. The healthier our ecosystems are, the healthier the planet \u2013 and its people. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration aims to prevent, halt and reverse the degradation of ecosystems on every continent and in every ocean. It can help to end poverty, combat climate change and prevent mass extinction. It will only succeed if everyone plays a part.*Hurricane Iota was initially deemed Category 5 in 2020 as instruments picked up wind speeds of over 160mph. In 2021, Iota was downgraded to Category 4 by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration after a post-storm analysis that determined that its maximum wind speed was 155 mph.",

    "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubWith just a few weeks to go until the opening of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly, the UN diplomatic community, as well as residents of New York City, are bracing for the annual arrival of Heads of State and Government from around the world, after two years of disruption wrought by COVID-19. Many details are still to be confirmed, but here are five things to look out for between 12 and 27 September.A new session means a new President of the General Assembly. The current PGA \u2013 as the UN acronym goes - Abdulla Shahid of the Maldives, will bow out, and Csaba K\u0151r\u00f6si of Hungary will take on the mantle for the next twelve months.The handover will take place on Monday, 12 September; Mr. Shahid will close the 76th session of the GA in the morning, and the 77th session will be officially opened at 3pm the same day (site goes live at that time).Mr. K\u0151r\u00f6si\u2019s has held several roles within his country\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, his most recent post being Director of Environmental Sustainability at the Office of the President of Hungary. He has been involved with the UN for several years, and the Presidency probably won\u2019t involve too much of a learning curve: Mr. K\u0151r\u00f6si\u00a0 served as Vice-President of the General Assembly during the 67th session in 2011-2012.As usual, international attention (as well as large numbers of police, and complaints about traffic jams from New York residents) will be centred around the High-Level Debate week, which begins on Tuesday 20 September.However, the Transforming Education Summit, which takes place the week before at UN Headquarters \u2013 on Friday 16, Saturday 17 and Monday 19 September \u2013 is billed as a major event by the organization.Friday is \u201cMobilization Day\u201d, which will be youth-led and youth-organized, bringing young people\u2019s concerns over their education to decision and policymakers, and will focus on mobilizing the global public, youth, teachers, civil society and others, to support the transformation of education across the world.The second day is all about solutions, and is designed to be a platform for initiatives that will contribute to transforming education. The day is grouped around five themes (\u201cThematic Action Tracks\u201d): inclusive, equitable, safe and healthy schools; learning and skills for life; work and sustainable development; teachers, teaching and the teaching profession; digital learning and transformation; and financing of education.The third day, on Monday 19 September, is Leaders Day, capitalizing on the fact that so many Heads of State and Government will be descending on New York that week. Expect a host of National Statements of Commitment from these leaders.The day will also feature the presentation of the Summit Youth Declaration and the Secretary-General\u2019s Vision Statement for Transforming Education.This year\u2019s SDG Moment, which will take place between 08:30 and 10:00 on Monday 19 September, immediately before Leader\u2019s Day of the Transforming Education Summit, will be an opportunity to refocus attention on the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN\u2019s 2030 Agenda, a blueprint for a fairer future for people and the planet.Speaking at the High-Level Political Forum \u2013 a key annual development forum \u2013 in July, Amina Mohammed, the Deputy Secretary-General, said that transitions in renewable energy, food systems and digital connectivity along with \u201cinvestments in human capital, financing the opportunities\u201d, are needed in order to turn multiple crises into opportunities.Ms. Mohammed said that this year\u2019s Moment will be \u201can opportunity to focus on these deep transitions, and on the work needed to get us back on track. It will also be an important milestone on the way to the 2023 SDG Summit.\u201dLast year\u2019s Moment was notable for the involvement of Korean megastars BTS, who reflected on the huge disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and challenged the notion that they are part of a \u201clost COVID generation\u201d.On 18 December 1992, UN Member States adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious, and Linguistic Minorities (UN Declaration on Minority Rights for short), described by the UN as a key instrument to address the political and civil, economic, social, and cultural rights of persons belonging to minorities.On Wednesday 21 September, in the Trusteeship Council Chamber, a High-Level Meeting will take place, as part of the year-long commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the Declaration. Speaking in June, Paolo David, Head of UN Human Rights\u2019 Indigenous Peoples and Minorities Section, said that, while the adoption of the Declaration brought hope three decades ago, this feeling was quickly lost due to the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Mr. David noted that minorities continue to be instrumentalised in many conflicts, including in Ukraine, Ethiopia, Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.Today, minorities face unprecedented barriers and challenges, according to the UN. In many countries they deal with modern threats such as online hate speech and are being stripped of citizenship rights.The event is billed as a chance to take stock of constraints and achievements, share examples of best practice, and set priorities for the future. The General Debate will overlap with Global Goals Week which, despite the name, is actually a nine-day programme of virtual and in-person events taking place between 16 and 25 September, involving more than 170 partners across civil society, business, academia, and the UN system, to accelerate action on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).There are too many events to list in full here, but they include NYC Climate Week, covering a wide range of climate-related challenges; the UN Private Sector Forum, run by UN Global Compact, which brings together business, the UN and civil society, to address global crises; and the launch of the 2002 Climate Action Project from Take Action Global, which brings classrooms from over 140 countries together, for a series of live interviews, school visits and social media takeovers.There will be plenty of SDG Media Zone videos to watch during Global Goals Week, with dozens of interesting speakers, including \u00a0content creators, influencers, activists and media partners, taking part in panel discussions that will highlight actions and solutions in support of the Sustainable Development Goals. The list of speakers will be announced nearer the time, here. A veteran Hungarian diplomat was appointed President of the forthcoming session of the UN General Assembly during an official ceremony in New York on Tuesday.\u00a0",

    "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubHumanitarians have stayed and delivered in Afghanistan in the year since the Taliban takeover, and it is imperative that the international community continues to do the same while the de facto authorities must also do their part, the Security Council heard on Monday.\u00a0UN Humanitarian Coordinator Martin Griffiths, who briefed ambassadors, reported on the ongoing hardships and uncertainty facing Afghans, nearly half of whom \u2013 24 million people \u2013 require aid relief to survive.\u00a0#Afghanistan is more than a humanitarian crisis. But it is not a hopeless crisis.Preserving basic service delivery alongside humanitarian assistance remains the only way to prevent a catastrophe even greater than what we have seen in the past year.My remarks:\u201cAfghanistan\u2019s crisis is a humanitarian crisis, but it\u2019s not only that. It\u2019s an economic crisis. It\u2019s a climate crisis. It\u2019s a hunger crisis. It\u2019s a financial crisis. But it\u2019s not a hopeless crisis,\u201d he said.\u00a0Although conflict, poverty, climate shocks and food insecurity have long been a \u201csad reality\u201d for Afghanistan, Mr. Griffiths outlined why the current situation is so critical.\u00a0Firstly, large-scale development assistance has been halted for a year in a country that was already facing severe levels of food insecurity and malnutrition, which have only deteriorated.\u00a0Humanitarians are also confronting an \u201cexceptionally challenging\u201d operating environment, he added, as engaging with the de facto authorities is \u201clabour intensive\u201d.\u00a0Furthermore, there is no confidence in the domestic banking sector which has sparked a liquidity crisis, that has affected aid delivery. A Humanitarian Exchange Facility intended to partially alleviate the liquidity crisis, is still being negotiated with Taliban leaders.\u00a0Meanwhile women and girls \u201chave been pushed to the sidelines\u201d, Mr. Griffiths added. Rights gains have been reversed, and adolescent girls have not attended school in a year.\u00a0\u201cIn the 21st century, we should not need to explain why girls\u2019 education and women\u2019s empowerment are important to them, to their communities, to their countries, and indeed to all of us,\u201d he said.\u00a0The UN relief chief stressed that preserving basic service delivery alongside humanitarian assistance \u201cremains the only way to prevent a catastrophe even greater than what we have seen these many months.\u201d\u00a0He reported that poverty is still deepening, the population continues to grow, and the de facto authorities have no budget to invest in their own future, making it clear that \u201csome development support needs to be restarted\u201d.\u00a0A $4.4 billion Humanitarian Response Plan for Afghanistan currently has a gap of $3.14 billion, he said.With winter approaching, more than $600 million is urgently needed to support priority preparedness activities, such as upgrades and repairs to shelters, as well as provision of warm clothes and blankets. \u00a0Additionally, $154 million is needed to pre-position supplies, including food and livelihood assistance, before the winter weather cuts off access to some areas of the country.\u00a0\u201cThe people of Afghanistan are still there. They have shown incredible resilience over the decades and in this last year.\u00a0Our task is to help them to prosper, to flourish and to be safe,\u201d said Mr. Griffiths, who also called for action by the de facto authorities.\u00a0\u201cBureaucratic interferences and procedures slow down humanitarian assistance when it is needed most. Female humanitarian aid workers \u2013 both national and international \u2013 must be allowed to work unhindered and securely. And girls must be allowed to continue their education.\u201d\u00a0Markus Potzel, the Secretary-General\u2019s Acting Special Representative for Afghanistan, reported on the UN\u2019s ongoing engagement with the de facto authorities, as well as efforts towards promoting inclusive governance, rights and freedoms.\u00a0He said the Taliban have been \u201cambiguous\u201d as to the extent to which they want to engage, predicated on being in accordance with their interpretation of Sharia law. \u00a0Mr. Potzel underlined the vital need to move \u201cbeyond an exchange of hardened positions\u201d towards a sustained dialogue between the Taliban, other Afghan stakeholders, the wider region and the international community.\u00a0\u201cSuch dialogue must place the interests of all Afghans at its centre,\"\u00a0he advised.\u00a0 \"The future stability of Afghanistan rests on meeting the needs of the Afghan people, preserving their rights, and reflecting the country\u2019s diversity in all governance structures.\"\u00a0On Thursday, UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, warned of the danger faced by Afghan refugees who continue to be detained and deported from Tajikistan, reiterating that it\u2019s illegal to force those fleeing persecution back to their homeland.",

    "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubThe outgoing High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, has told UN News in an interview to mark the end of her term in office that she\u2019s always spoken out and felt free to act, while acknowledging that doing the job is \u201ca constant and permanent struggle\u201d to prevent governments from restricting essential freedoms.\u00a0In an in-depth interview with UN News, ahead of officially leaving her post on Wednesday, the two-time former president of Chile and head of UN Women, looked back over her four years heading her office, OHCHR, and said while human rights had gone backwards in some areas, there have been \u201cimportant steps in others.\u201d\u00a0\u201cAs always in life, you have good moments and difficult moments, and you have to work with both\u201d, she said, adding that she\u2019d never been compelled to keep quiet in the top rights job.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI always felt free to say, or not to say, what I thought it was necessary to do.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0One the issue of the long-awaited report relating to her\u00a0recent visit to China, which has yet to be published, Ms. Bachelet said that she had made her position clear to Chinese officials, and said all that she had come to say, on the first visit by a UN rights chief in 17 years.\u00a0\u00a0She describes running OHCHR as a \u201csometimes contradictory mandate\u201d where you have to both be \u201cthe voice of the voiceless\u201d, and also engage with sometime unsympathetic Member States on the highest diplomatic level to provide guidance, expertise, and bolster monitoring and reporting.\u00a0\u00a0And she\u2019s got plenty of advice to pass on to her successor, once they are chosen, she tells us.\u00a0Michelle Bachelet:\u00a0Well, I will have to answer again what I told you four years ago.\u00a0It's a task that never ends, so probably there's a lot of things we were not able to do or to achieve. With the civil society, with other agencies, we have had some important steps. Like, for example, the decision of the General Assembly, that there is a human right \u2013\u00a0a right to a healthy environment\u00a0- and the fight against pollution, and so on.\nI believe that\u00a0the worst threat for humanity is what we call the triple planetary crisis; climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss.Michelle BacheletThis was a long-time fight from civil society, but afterwards, a very strong partnership between us and WHO, pushing for that. And then there was the Human Rights Council resolution, that then went to the General Assembly and was also, I would say, approved by a big majority or a strong majority. So, I think that was really important.I believe that\u00a0the worst threat for humanity is what we call the triple planetary crisis; climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss. So, if the Member States walk the talk, I think it will be a really important step.But we also got some other things. I would say we have seen certain trends towards\u00a0abolition of the death penalty. Over 170 countries either have abolished already, or have established a moratorium\u00a0on the death penalty and more countries have announced that they're going to go in the same direction. That I think is very good news as well.In some places we have been able to support people, so their voices are being heard, so laws have been changed - for the better, if I may say, in terms of protecting and promoting human rights, women's rights or children's rights.Also, I will say that we have been working towards the protection of human rights defenders.It's\u00a0always a job that has to have big goals and medium ones and smaller ones, because you have to do so many different things. So, we'll need to continue working.\u00a0If any High Commissioner said everything's done, I would say hello, no, that's not reality.\u00a0Michelle\u00a0Bachelet:\u00a0Well, you're right, the world has changed dramatically I would say over the four years. Of course, you mentioned already the pandemic, and increasingly strong impact of climate change. And now we're seeing the reverberating shocks of the food, fuel and finance crisis as a consequence of the war in Ukraine.We have seen also huge polarization on the international level, and also we have seen protest movements and coups d\u2019\u00e9tats in Myanmar and Burkina Faso and Guinea and Mali, and also the takeover of the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nI would say\u00a0it's a constant and permanent struggle\u00a0to not only be aware, but to call on Member States to continue (with their) responsibility that is to protect and promote, and also to support civil society so they can do their part as well.Michelle BacheletAnd so I would say this is not something that goes only in one direction, because on one side,\u00a0yes, you can see a lot of things that are going in the wrong direction and they're not helping human rights.We cannot take it for granted because nobody thought a new war could come in Europe, and we have one, and we thought that human rights was a given, and it\u2019s not.And we saw that countries who always speak about human rights, (do) not necessarily always respect them.I would say\u00a0it's a constant and permanent struggle\u00a0to not only be aware, but to call on Member States to continue (with their) responsibility that is to protect and promote, and also to support civil society so they can do their part as well. (We) have seen so many important movements, young people demonstrating for the planet, women, the Me Too campaign\u2026Or, Black Lives Matter and all the demonstrations in favour of stopping systemic racism, and so on. So, I would say\u00a0there has been (a) reverse in some areas, but on the other hand, there have been important step in others. So as always in life, you have good moments and difficult moments, and you have to work with both.Michelle Bachelet:\u00a0Well, I mean there are different kinds of things. Sometimes\u00a0you have to deal with terrible individual cases that really touch you very much. But on the other hand, when you go into a place and you see the pain of the people - I just came back from Cox\u2019s Bazar talking to Rohingyas and seeing they\u2019re asking us, the UN, to ensure that they can go back to Myanmar. And we\u2019re not able right now to ensure, because the right conditions are not there so they can go in in a safe manner.But on the other hand, you see people there full of energy and enthusiastic, and willing to go back to their country. One of the issues that was very difficult, not only in the world but also in the office (OHCHR) was the COVID-19 pandemic because it meant that everything was changed.We had to learn to adapt to the new situation, to live in different circumstances. The shutdown, the quarantines, were really complicated for many people, for our colleagues as well, with little children and so on. And on the other hand, we had to deal with the lack of equalities in terms of access to vaccines, access to treatment.Looking again\u00a0how COVID-19 laid bare all the inequalities in the world are, that made it for me so clear, that after we are able to recover from the pandemic, our goal was not to go back to normality, because that normality was very bad.\u00a0That normality brought us to that (point), but also gave us the possibility of discussing, OK, what do we want for the future? So that's why\u00a0we started talking about \u201cbuild back better\u201d but now we are changing that to \u201cbuild forward better\u201d, if I may say. So, always something that is a problem, can bring opportunities.\u00a0Michelle Bachelet: Well, first of all, I am a UN Under-Secretary-General, so every time I speak, I speak (as the) High Commission of Human Rights of the UN, so\u00a0I'm always independent to say what I think I have to say. But I don't speak as a person, I speak as the UN.I've always felt free in terms of saying what I thought should be said, or what I thought that was important.I always try to identify what's the best in every single situation, because not every situation is the same.\u00a0Sometimes you have no other choice than to speak, and very strongly. In some others you can feel that maybe you can use different strategies, and but\u00a0I have never felt that somebody imposed (on) me to be silent. I always felt free to say, or not to say, what I thought it was necessary to do.Michelle Bachelet:\u00a0Well, I think first of all, I have to say, this was the first trip of a High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 17 years and I had the opportunity to meet with national authorities, regional authorities and local authorities - provincial authorities - and\u00a0I was able to convey all the messages that I thought it was important for them to hear from a High Commissioner of Human Rights, and to make our observations on what things should change and how everything - I would say law and policy - should be in compliance with international human rights law, and I was able to freely say all that I thought needed to be discussed with them.It\u2019s important with everyone, that I need to have a dialogue and a relation and engage all Member States and all stakeholders, and I always think sometimes dialogue can produce good results, sometimes not.I don\u2019t change it if it\u2019s China or the UK or US, or a developing country, we have defined with them certain follow-ups; how (to) work in the future with OHCHR with them in terms of analysing certain laws that we feel are not in compliance with human rights laws, but also in terms of discussing issues like minority and human rights; ethnic groups and human rights; freedom of religion and human rights; business and human rights.\u00a0Michelle Bachelet:\u00a0We continue working on all of these issues, but\u00a0I would like the international community not to forget about those situations, and sometimes because so many things are on the agenda and some things take more relevance in the media politically speaking, some of them particularly on the protracted conflict, I feel they're forgotten, and people are feeling abandoned by the international community. For example, we see in Yemen that despite the truce there are violations.And so we think that the ceasefire is a good thing, but we need now political dialogue, political process and ensure protection of civilians. So I think the reduction of hostility has improved the capacity of humanitarian actors to support there.On the Sahel, for example, during my visit to Burkina Faso, I saw in Burkina, Niger, Mali, there are so many intersecting crises over there. And I think it's important the international community step up its support for that.\nMy advice would be, to\u00a0be open, to engage with all Member States with stakeholders, to explain why it's so difficult, this position, because it asks you to be the voice of the voiceless.Michelle BacheletMichelle Bachelet:\u00a0Well, I hope I will have a personal conversation with him or her, whoever is chosen. And yes, my advice would be, first of all, I want to share my experiences, things that many times you don't know before you arrive in this position - that I can offer lessons learned.And my advice would be, to\u00a0be open, to engage with all Member States with stakeholders, to explain why it's so difficult, this position, because it asks you to be the voice of the voiceless. But on the other hand, it asks you to engage with Member States, give technical assistance, capacity building, but also monitoring and reporting. So\u00a0it's a pretty sometimes contradictory mandate, that makes it not always easy, but there are ways to deal with it\u00a0and to navigate that. So, I want to give them particular advice, regarding each of those points.In August, Michelle Bachelet, twice-elected President of Chile and the first head of UN Women, was confirmed as the new UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, replacing Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein.",

    "maintext": "SubscribeAudio HubNearly eight million people in South Sudan are facing severe levels of food insecurity at a time when the cost of staple items and fuel have shot up due to supply chain disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine, the World Food Programme (WFP) has reported.\n\u00a0Pockets of catastrophic hunger, technically famine, are already present in eight locations in the country, while violence has prevented the UN agency from consistently reaching another area where people were already going hungry last year.South Sudan is also facing a fourth year of unprecedented flooding that has displaced hundreds of thousands of people and sparked clashes between farming and herding communities.Matthew Hollingworth, WFP Country Director in South Sudan, spoke to UN News about how fallout from what he called the \u201cera-defining\u2019\u201d war in Ukraine is being felt thousands of kilometres away.He warned that WFP will have to make \u201ctough choices\u201d this year, including prioritizing aid delivery to only the most vulnerable.\u00a0More than 10 years after South Sudan gained independence, the country cannot afford to fail, Mr. Hollingworth said, though stressing that what is needed above all is peace. \u00a0This interview has been edited and condensed for publication.Matthew Hollingworth:\u00a0The overall number of people needing any form of humanitarian assistance right now this year in South Sudan is 8.9 million, one of the highest people-in-need figures that we\u2019ve ever had. Of those, based on the latest food security Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) - the main assessment that we use to look at food insecurity in a country - there are 7.74 million people who will face severe levels of acute food insecurity this lean season, so from April to July. That\u2019s 63 per cent of the population of this country. Those are some of the worst figures we\u2019ve ever had, certainly since this country was born as an independent state in 2011.\u00a0What\u2019s caused it, or what is causing it, is clearly the amount of violence that this country still sees on a daily basis, and the accumulation of that violence over many years. We have had three years of unprecedented flooding, and we\u2019re going into a fourth year. Agriculturalists and pastoralists who have basically survived, lived and sustained themselves through the same farming roles for generations, can no longer do so because their land has changed forever. It\u2019s now under water. And, of course, in a place like South Sudan, when you talk about displacement, that displacement then has an impact on stability and peace. So, we have issues of violence, conflict, being created because, for example, pastoralists along with their animals have been displaced into territory where other people live or have lived.\u00a0We\u2019ve also seen massive cost increases on commodities over the last three years primarily because of COVID, and what COVID did to supply chains. More recently, we\u2019ve had fuel costs increase which is certainly having an impact on the cost of food. \u00a0And the last point of course is that yes, the war in Ukraine and what that is doing to food prices and fuel crises globally, and how that impacts on the South Sudanese.UN News:\u00a0Let\u2019s go into that because there are so many layers to what is happening in South Sudan. Ukraine is thousands of kilometres away, but the UN and WFP have been speaking about the fallouts impacting individual countries and peoples.Matthew Hollingworth:\u00a0Russia and Ukraine represent about 30 per cent of the world\u2019s cereals exports. That means so many countries that rely on importing cereals from Russia and Ukraine, if that flow of a key food commodity is impacted in any way, it has a major impact on what is typically a staple of diets across the world. Now in South Sudan, that is not the mainstay of the diet. It\u2019s sorghum or maize, as key cereals. But we are surrounded by countries that rely on wheat. And if wheat prices go up, and if wheat availability goes down, the price of sorghum and maize goes up as a ripple effect of what\u2019s happening in Ukraine.We\u2019re already seeing an increasing price of sorghum and maize in the country. \u00a0We\u2019re seeing an already significant increase on vegetable oil, already 15 per cent since the beginning of the year. And again, South Sudan doesn\u2019t necessarily eat the high-coast sunflower oil that is produced in Ukraine and is not being exported because of the crisis, as it usually would be. But the vegetable oil here still is going up in price because globally, there\u2019s less available or there is a fear that there is less available in the future.The cost of fuel is going up. \u00a0We\u2019re already seeing at least a $300,000 per month additional cost for aviation fuel. On the fuel that we use to move trucks around the country\u2013 and the vast majority of what is moved for the humanitarian community is by truck \u2013 those prices have gone up by a million dollars a month. \u00a0If fuel prices continue as they are just today, that will be $8 million more required just to move trucks around the country this year.UN News:\u00a0WFP is facing those astronomical transport costs. \u00a0How will you be able to sustain this?Matthew Hollingworth:\u00a0Right now, we know we can\u2019t. Even though those numbers sound big, but they are dwarfed by what we need to support those millions in South Sudan. \u00a0We are currently $600 million short for our programmes for the next six months. There are so many mega crises in the world today \u2013 Ukraine, Yemen, Afghanistan, in the eastern Horn of Africa because of the drought, the Syria refugee crisis, Ethiopia and the Tigray crisis, the situation of the Sudanese in the north \u2013 we have all of these crises, and what it means is that donors do not have the resources to meet the enormity of the humanitarian needs in the world.\u00a0Ukraine is an era-defining crisis. It is, suffice it to say, going to have an impact everywhere. And one of those impacts is humanitarian donors, Member States and humanitarian institutions will not have the money to meet the enormity of the needs that the world sees. \u00a0And we will not meet the increased needs of various countries and around the world, including in South Sudan, because of that enormity that the Ukraine is making even harder.\u00a0UN News: Given the astronomical rise in costs, what steps are WFP taking, and as needs are rising?Matthew Hollingworth:\u00a0 We are calling on donors to recognize that first of all, this is still the youngest nation in the world, and it\u2019s in a pretty fragile state. We are getting towards the end of what has been a very difficult unstable transitional period. We have a Transitional Government of National Unity brought together by the various parties who were fighting one another off-and-on for the last seven years. That political agreement could break, and we\u2019re coming to the culmination of it. And what\u2019s happening as we come to the end is this enormous instability because we\u2019re seeing poverty levels and humanitarian needs at levels never seen before. So, on the one hand we are saying to donors \u2018let\u2019s be cognizant of the fact that this country that was only really birthed 10 years ago is in a very precarious situation\u2019.\u00a0 What we can\u2019t do is let a humanitarian crisis in this country put us back on the wrong track, harm the peace process even further. And remember, we\u2019re seeing conflict all the time still in South Sudan \u2013 44,000 people were displaced last week because of fighting in Unity State alone.Obviously, we\u2019re also having to take some really tough choices. Eight months ago, we had to make that awful decision to, as it were, take from the hungry to give to the starving. We reduced the rations we were providing to refugees from the Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, etc, in order to increase rations in the areas where South Sudan was seeing the likelihood of famine. We can\u2019t reduce their rations any further. They are only getting 50 per cent. That\u2019s not enough in terms of sustaining a healthy life . It\u2019s really already providing the very scrapings of the barrel, as it were, of what they need. But with enormous needs outstanding, what we need to do now is unfortunately prioritize only the most vulnerable. So, what we will do in the next six months is only assist the people in catastrophic and emergency levels of food insecurity. But that means we will stop providing some of the forms of assistance we give in areas where people are in less extreme levels of food insecurity.But that has an impact as well because we are getting to a point of electioneering, the politics that happen before an election. And if you don\u2019t provide support in certain areas because their needs are less, it can be misconstrued politically. The prioritization will be happening based on a vulnerability analysis, but to those effected it could be seen as \u2018why are they getting and I am not getting?\u2019 When you start getting \u2018us-and-them\u2019 arguments over aid, at a time of political instability, it\u2019s a problematic recipe, but it\u2019s one we\u2019re going to have to walk very, very carefully through to ensure that the messaging is clear.\u00a0UN News:\u00a0Mr. Hollingworth, thank you for speaking to us. \u00a0Is there anything further you would like our audience to know about WFP\u2019s work in South Sudan?Matthew Hollingworth:\u00a0One area that is very important is that in a country like South Sudan, there are so many communities that live in real isolation. They have experienced that marginalization, that disenfranchisement, for decades and decades. What we would really like to be doing is support those communities through real development investment. \u00a0In order to do that, there is one key thing we need, and we haven\u2019t had enough of. It\u2019s not money; it\u2019s peace. \u00a0Because when you don\u2019t have peace, you spend so much more money on responding to the humanitarian crises and the humanitarian needs.\u00a0Whereas if there were peace, we should have already been now phasing out humanitarian activities and only be seeing development activities, and actually be handing over responsibilities to Government entities. But instead of that happening, we are still now having to be making those life-saving decisions when actually we should just be focusing on life-changing activities, but we can\u2019t. \u00a0With peace, we could be making the difference to ensure that communities in South Sudan wouldn\u2019t have to be concerned about wars 7,000 miles away, and the impact of those wars on availability and access in their community, because they would be able to look after themselves. They would be able to meet their own needs.\n\u00a0The UN has allocated $100 million to fight hunger in Africa and the Middle East as the spillover effects of the war in Ukraine threaten to push millions even closer to famine.\u00a0",

    "maintext": "The late Colombian drug trafficker Pablo Escobar, founder, and top leader of the Medellin Cartel, died on December 2, 1993.Almost 28 years after he was killed, some people wonder what happened to the two children he had with his wife Victoria Eugenia Henao Vallejo 'La Tata', whom the capo married when she was fifteen years old, in 1976 .(You may be interested in:\u00a0Pablo Escobar and the properties he had in Colombia and around the world).Read all about what Juan Pablo Escobar Henao, 44, and Manuela Escobar Henao, 37, currently do:(Read this:\u00a0Five top places in Colombia to go on vacation).After realizing all the damage that his father caused to Colombia and the world, he decided to completely move away from the capo's illegal activities and violence. According to what he himself has said on his Facebook account and in one of his books, when Escobar died he called journalist Yamid Amat, to tell him:\u201cI personally want to make it very clear that I will not avenge this. I will not avenge the death of my father because now the only thing that worries me is the future of my family. I will fight to move forward and educate ourselves in order to be good people and if I can do something so that there is peace, for ever and ever in this country, I will do it\".In that moment he decided to follow a different path. The Colombian authorities changed his birth name to Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Marroquin Santos, for security reasons and to remove the stigma that having the name of the famous drug trafficker could entail.He is currently an architect, industrial designer, writer, pacifist, and public speaker in Argentina.He has told the story of his father in different formats. Among these you can find the biographical documentary 'Pecados de mi padre' [My father\u2019s sins] (2009), Pablo Escobar, mi padre: Las historias que no deber\u00edamos saber' [Pablo Escobar, my father. The stories we shouldn\u2019t know] (2014), and 'Pablo Escobar In Fraganti: Lo que mi padre nunca me cont\u00f3' [Pablo Escobar In Fraganti: What my father never told me] (2016); and the documentary 'Escobar al descubierto' [Escobar Uncovered] (2017).Today, he has two businesses in Argentina, an architecture studio called Box Arquitectura Latinoamericana and a clothing brand called Escobar Henao.(We recommend:\u00a0These are the best free courses from the top universities in the world).The 44-year-old man is married and has a son named Juan Emilio. In his mission to carry a message of peace and non-violence, he has dedicated his life to public speaking around the world and give conferences where he talks about the terrible consequences of drug trafficking. He also has a YouTube channel where he spreads that message and shares unreleased audios and interviews.On several occasions he has thanked his father for \u201cshowing me the path I shouldn\u2019t take\u201d. In the same way, he has written in his Instagram posts that he does not miss the \u201ccriminal\u201d, but he does miss his father.Manuela Escobar Henao, who was born on May 25, 1984, was only 9 years old when the drug trafficker Pablo Escobar died. Like Juan Pablo, she changed her name to Juana Manuela Marroqu\u00edn Santos.Manuela is currently 37 years old and apparently lives either in Palermo or in Buenos Aires, Argentina.Contrary to her brother, she has preferred to remain anonymous. She does not use social media and has walked away from her past. Therefore, not much is known about her life.\u201cMy sister is NOT a public person, she enjoys her privacy and having the privilege of leading a normal life. She owes nothing to anyone and lives peacefully around us and those who love her. We respect her privacy\u201d said her brother in an Instagram post when asked why Manuela had made the decision not to have contact with public opinion.(You deserve it:\u00a0The top places to live during retirement).The writer Jos\u00e9 Alejandro Casta\u00f1o, who lived with the Escobar family for years, released the book \u2018Cierra los ojos princesa\u2019 [Close your eyes princess], which talks about Manuela\u2019s life.In it, he describes her as someone with a melancholic personality, who went from being a girl who had everything to having to face several issues after her family was denied asylum in the United States and Germany after Escobar's death.\u201cManuela\u2019s drama began when her father died, and she had no way of understanding what was going on. She was too young to understand\u201d, Says the writer, who in an interview said that, in fact, unable to rebuild her life, she apparently tried to commit suicide.After her mother and brother were arrested in 1999 - when they were accused of money laundering and falsification of documents - Manuela fell into a terrible depression and had to seek psychological treatment. In fact, she dropped out of school and was homeschooled.Here is one of her more recent pictures:Who is Antonela Roccuzzo?

    "maintext": "*This interview was carried out a few months ago, before knowing the verdict with which the influencer was sentenced to 63 months in jail.Three million followers on social networks. 230 employees. Six hair salons. However, if the life of Daneidy Barrera, the controversial influencer, comes down to numbers, she prefers to talk about a second chance. In this interview, she told her story to EL TIEMPO's School of Multimedia Journalism, class of 2021-I.She spoke about drugs, religion, regrets, mental health, success, entrepreneurship, the famous keratins and why she says that Colombia is a classist and homophobic country.(We recommend:\u00a0Maluma, the 'pretty boy' who conquered the world).Epa Colombia\u2019s videos don\u2019t fit into one single category. There are controversial ones, such as the time she broke a turnstile, glass, and equipment at a Transmilenio station using a hammer in the middle of protests. Or when she promoted the services of sex workers from the trans community. She records videos from her house\u2019s terrace, in the middle of a puddle, or on old broken buses. In her networks, she talks about the daily life of low-income neighborhoods. Moreover, she comes up with cheerleading routines and before the pandemic she used to record herself in nightclubs working as a DJ.She studied sports training at SENA but didn\u2019t finish. \u201cWhen I made the first viral video of Epa Colombia, they expelled me, because they said that I was not giving a good example and that they did not need people like that\u201d, she says. That video, however, was shared by the president at the time, Juan Manuel Santos.(Keep reading:\u00a0'There were some indecent proposals... It was a painful situation': Karol G).They are the best memories I have of my life because that is where I learned to be a strong and courageous woman. The street is where you meet people who have different needs, who sell their products on a corner waiting for someone to buy. When you grow up seeing that, you become very brave. You learn to value life.I did not have a good education. Since I was little my mother used to say that I was very hyperactive and annoying. I used to draw a lot of attention to myself because I could never sit still.Because of that, they didn\u2019t like me at my schools. Also, I had very bad friends. All my friends used drugs and I did not use drugs at first, but they told me: \u201cdo it, try it, take a risk, it is really cool\u201d That was when I got involved with drugs even though I didn\u2019t need them because despite the fact that my parents did not have that much money and we did not do so well in the madrug\u00f3n sells, we always had food on the table and school supplies. But I got carried away because of my friends, I\u2019ve always been easy to persuade. Yes, I was studying at SENA. Some of my classmates said they were going to watch Colombia\u2019s soccer match. I told them that I was not going to join them because I didn't even have money to buy a beer. So, I told my mom to buy me a jersey from the Colombian team and she told me that I wanted it to go out to drink and she bought it herself. So, I recorded myself saying: \u201cHello everyone if you have to watch the match by yourself you are on my team. What\u2019s important is to have good health and peace. (\u2026) E, e, e, e, epa Colombia, nice, nice, nice, ha ha ha ha ha, mua \u201d.Because I have friends from the LGBT community and they always say \u201cepa la arepa, epa el chorizo\u201d and I thought to myself: \u201cWhy not say 'epa Colombia' if we are in a party?\u201d So, I made that video, but it didn\u2019t go viral immediately. The following day when I went to study at SENA they told me: \u201cThat is so embarrassing, you became famous, delete that video.\u201d And I told them I wouldn\u2019t do it. Since I was little I dreamed of being famous, having surgery, and being a successful woman. However, everyone made fun of me because I didn't have an education and I didn't have the means to be an entrepreneur. That's when I started making videos full time. Some people laughed at my videos, but they followed me and when you have so many followers many small brands or even some big companies begin to advertise with you to promote any product. So, I started saving money and the first thing I did was getting surgery.(You may be interested in:\u00a0Who is Valentina Ferrer, J Balvin\u2019s girlfriend?).Yes. Epa Colombia is all like: \u201cHello friends, I love it, I love it very much, ha ha ha\u201d, but when I log out from social media I am a very calm woman. I am even shy, normal, and patient. On the other hand, when I go online I am a star. I play with my voice and the way I act. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to make Daneidy famous. Who will follow a quiet girl? I made Epa Colombia famous because she is a strong woman who is larger than life, has an incredible personality, and look how far I\u2019ve come.I think the real success is when you change. When you stop bad habits and vices. It is believing in yourself. Because I can seem fine on the outside, but if I have envy, bad feelings, resentment, or anger inside, that is not success. That happened to me when I vandalized Transmilenio. I was a terrible woman, but when that happened and they took my social networks, it was the best for me. I searched for God. I started looking at what was wrong with me. I lost many friends because they were only there for my followers and what they could get for free. I changed. Then, when I went back to social media people told me that I looked more focused.Yes, it used to be a very normal treatment and I wanted to use amino acids to straighten the hair. But I couldn't find that in Colombia. A friend helped me to find that product abroad so that hair gets 100% straight. At first I didn't sell that many, only 10 or 15 jars. I remember going from one hair salon to the next. I offered to pay them for advertising to help me promote my products while I went back to social media. I\u2019ve been called \u201clow life, disgusting, stupid, mediocre\u201d. However, I am an entrepreneur and businesswoman who wants to create jobs and get ahead in life.Yes. I don't know why people in Colombia act like that. For example, I live with a trans friend and people tell her that she is disgusting. There is a lot of hypocrisy in this country. They discriminate against a person because of their sexual orientation. Some say that it is a sin, that God does not approve, that they hope they (LGBTQ people) die. But the only one who can judge you is God, not people.(You deserve it:\u00a0Top five destinations to include in your vacation plans for 2021).I ask myself: Are they truly following God? I am a lesbian, and I am blessed. Those people say that I am possessed. Yet, I don\u2019t think they should judge anyone, they should be praying instead of discriminating against people.I only regret what I did on TransMilenio. I was persuaded by my friends. They told me: \u201cGo ahead, we are in the middle of a protest. Just do it, there is nothing to it\u201d What I truly did was hurt my life. They could have put me in jail. I committed three crimes that added up to more than three years in prison. God and the judge gave me a chance. I do not regret the character of Epa Colombia, but I am very sorry for that video. I took it down five minutes after uploading it, but it had already gone viral.I want to be remembered as a woman who was given a second chance and moved on. Someone who gives people the opportunity to work, the number one seller of keratins. The queen of keratins. This is how I want to be remembered.Five top places in Colombia to go on vacationWho is Antonela Roccuzzo?

    "maintext": "He wasn\u2019t a sensation yet, or so he thought.He was 18 years old. It was his first trip to Mexico City and his song \u2018Farandulera\u2019 had just hit the radio stations (his first big hit) and his managers- who were his aunt Yudy Arias and her husband, Juan Parra - did not consider getting a security scheme, not even a couple of assistants.When they arrived in the Mexican capital, an airport official approached them in the baggage claim area and asked them: \u201cWho is Maluma?\u201d A little scared, the young Colombian raised his hand: \u201cIt's me, what's wrong?\u201d, To which the guy replied: \u201cIt is crazy outside. I recommend that you do not go out \u201d.(We recommend:\u00a0Five top places in Colombia to go on vacation).In a matter of seconds, the young Colombian artist had to face a riot of young girls crying, screaming, and trying to kiss him, rip his clothes and even his curls. \u201cI was not worried about me, but about my aunt who was expecting her second child\u201d Maluma recalls. \u201cShe was almost six months pregnant.\u201dYudy, who was not the target, was able to get to the car. However, the singer and his manager were trapped by the hysterical mass.\u00a0Parra saw that there was a patrol 10 meters away, grabbed Maluma by the arm as best he could and together they made their way, walking over the fallen bodies, towards the official vehicle. \u201cIt was all very crazy because none of the security at the airport helped, nobody did a damn thing. When we got to the police car I told the officer to help me. I literally managed to get to the policeman's window, I knocked on the glass and said: 'look what is happening around you' and he didn't care about anything, he looked at me and basically told me to \u2018Figure it out\u2019.They looked at each other and realized they were scratched and bloody. So, thinking only about their survival - which of course comes with some violence - they decided to move towards the car that was waiting for them. \u201cIt took us an hour to get into the car. On the way they beat me and scratched me, it was very scary. Now I can laugh at that, but I remember that my aunt cried. That was the day I said: 'This is not normal.'And indeed. From then on, Maluma became one of the greatest musical icons in Colombia, Latin America, and the world. In fact, behind the footsteps of Vives, Shakira, Juanes, and J. Balvin, the 26-year-old is, most likely, the Colombian artist with the largest paycheck today. Actually, for the last five years, all his concerts - in any stadium or arena in the world - have been sold out in advance and leave an average of 2 million dollars at the box office. It is enough to understand that the 'Pretty Boy' has become a global celebrity.Juan Luis Londo\u00f1o was born in Medell\u00edn in 1994. His relatives say that he came to the world with one green eye and one brown/honey color. As a child he sang rancheras and salsa, the latter is one of his favorite genres. He was baptized in the Catholic church and today he walks the steps of Buddhism. A left-handed, he was on his way to be a soccer player\u2013one of the good ones- , according to the Colombian National Team midfielder Juan Fernando Quintero\u2013, but life had other plans for him, and he followed the path of reggaeton.A disciplined, meticulous, and competitive guy who already has five studio albums, 'Magia' (2012), 'Pretty Boy, Dirty Boy' (2015), 'F.A.M.E.' (2018), 11:11 (2019), and 'Papi Juancho' (2020); which won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Pop Vocal Album (2018). This is the guy who performed the Spanish version of the song 'Colors', the anthem of the 2018 Soccer World Cup. Moreover, on October 22 he will receive the \u201cBillboard Spirit of Hope Award\u201d, he has a Gulfstream G450 airplane worth approximately $22 million, and rubs shoulders with the Kardashians, Puff Daddy, Madonna, Marc Anthony, Shakira, and Jennifer L\u00f3pez. In fact, he has just shot a romantic comedy titled 'Marry Me' with JLo, which will be released on February 12, 2021, and which is his Hollywood debut.This is Maluma, an artistic name that is the combination of the first two letters of the names of his mother (Marlli), his father (Luis) and his sister (Manuela). A true superstar.(Keep reading:\u00a0'There were some indecent proposals... It was a painful situation': Karol G).Very serious. The truth is that I thought I was going to become a professional soccer player. I went from playing the Pony-soccer category, in a team called Bolillo G\u00f3mez, to the lower divisions of Nacional. Then I went to the U-14, to the U-15, and I went to play at La Equidad, with Alexis Garc\u00eda, in Medell\u00edn. I spent two years there. I had the opportunity to make a couple of trips to Bogot\u00e1, but obviously playing in the capital is totally different, the altitude affects you a lot. But yes. I definitely did want to be a professional player.The truth is, yes I was very creative. Creative attacking midfielder. I was fast and I could think fast. If I had put in my ten thousand hours on soccer, maybe I would have become a professional.No. No one can take his position.Against. When he played in Envigado and I was in Nacional, it was annoying. Whenever we had to spot Juanfer, it was impossible. He is a very talented player.My grandparents and my uncles helped us a lot, because my father went down-hill when it comes to finances. I had to take charge and continue moving forward. I used to buy a bag that had about 35 pieces of candy and that cost me about $1,500 pesos at that time. Later, I would go to school and sell each candy for a thousand pesos. Same with the sandwiches. That's how I made my money.Yes, I was romantic since I was little. In my family we have been very sensitive to art and writing. And yes, at school I liked to help my friends a little when they ended a relationship. I was there for them.My sister already had a tattoo, and she was the one who took me to the Premium Plaza Shopping Mall in El Poblado. I was 14 years old, and I wanted to write Maluma on my left leg, who, as people already know, represents the love that I have for my family. And that's where my stage name comes from. It's true that Manuela helped me, but there are things that she didn't help me with, like when I told her to take me to the X Factor.(Read this:\u00a0These are the countries currently requesting a covid passport).I was 13 years old, I wanted to go to The X Factor, I prepared a song by Andr\u00e9s Cepeda, I printed the form, filled it out, gave it to Manuela and she did not take me. She didn't want to take me, which, by the way, I didn\u2019t know then, but she was making me a favor [laughs].It all started because a friend at school, Arias, had already recorded a song. I was 16 years old, and I told my aunt that I really wanted to go to the studio, and she was the one who paid for my first hours there. She went with me and supported me. She and her husband Juan were the ones who started my career. And that was the foundation of everything. They were the ones who helped me build my brand and, they did a great job.That was Arias. He was the one who told me to go together. We were supposed to meet at five in the afternoon and he arrived about half an hour late and I couldn't miss my hours. So, I decided to do my first song alone. I recorded it and by the time he arrived, it was too late.I saw him about a month ago. He came to my apartment, and we remembered those times. And I told him: \u201cYou see what happened because of your messiness, because of your tardiness, that's where the duet of Maluma and Arias died\u201d. The truth is that we have both done very well, each of us in our own way.He did because he was too slow.I was two years away from graduating from high school when this all got serious. At school they were very supportive of me pursuing my dream and thanks to them I was able to graduate. And also, thanks to my friends from school who helped me a lot with my work. I came to classes tired all the time because I had to play soccer during the weekends, then at night I had to go sing, the next day go train, and then sing again, and on Monday I had school. That's when I decided to quit football and put all that energy into my musical career.(It's incredible:\u00a0Benefits of intermittent fasting).I came to training one day and told the coach that I was going to start singing reggaeton. He couldn\u2019t believe it. All my teammates made fun of me and laughed but I said: \u201cOk, you will see that I am going to make my dreams come true and one day you will remember this moment\u201d. It was the best decision I could have made.One day my dad picked me up from a training session and, when we were getting home, I told him: \u201cDad, I won't train again, I won't play soccer again, I'm going to sing reggaeton\u201d. And he almost had a heart attack. The man suffered a lot. Then, he was in a bakery once, and on a radio he heard, in one of the credits, my name, Maluma. He called me crying and said: \u201cG\u00fcev\u00f3n, I can't believe, this was serious\u201d. And from then on, he supported me. My family in general has supported me in everything I have wanted to do, absolutely everything.I learned to sing with Mirabay Montoya. I love her very much. She was the first person to truly scold me, so to speak.Yes, it was crazy. It was overnight. I closed my eyes, I opened them again and every weekend we had fifteen-year-old birthday parties and gigs at clubs. The first clubs where I played in Colombia were in Bogot\u00e1. I was 17 years old, and I had to go with a work team and with a letter signed by my parents saying that I had permission to work.Ha! The first show that I got paid for was in Neiva, in a party. They paid me for 45 minutes and I sang \u2018Farandulera\u2019 for 30 minutes in different versions. I went back to singing the chorus without the track, I grabbed the birthday girl, sang happy birthday, and started looking at my manager to ask for time. And he would tell me: \u201cKeep going, keep going\u201d. I smile every time I remember that.Yes. There was no budget to buy plane tickets or rooms. So, we toured Colombia in a van. It was super uncomfortable: my assistant, my manager, my DJ, four dancers, the backup singer and me. We did four, five or six shows in a row. On Sunday I would arrive at my house exhausted. And on Monday again, we would start over. If I had not had that discipline that I learned in soccer, I would not have made it in this industry.Because all the houses in Colombia were able to know a little beyond Maluma. They were able to meet Juan Luis and that was very important. The show gave me the chance to connect with the Colombian audience, and that is where my career went to the next level. There I started touring in Bogot\u00e1, in the Centro de Eventos of Autopista Norte, there were fifteen thousand people and then in Medell\u00edn, in the Macarena, it was sold out. That's where Maluma's big movement began.I had only seen that on YouTube videos. When Michael Jackson was out. But, back then, I didn't imagine it for myself. There was the break, which was not just a song, but a movement in general in my career.Absolutely. The first concerts I did in the United States, on the first tour, were crazy. And it is still a dream. In 2018, when I arrived at Madison Square, I saw a screen that said: \u201cCongratulations Maluma, sold out.\u201d At the Garden! I went on stage, and I almost threw up with joy. We finished the concert, I met with my family and my work team, and we all began to cry. It was a way to give thanks because I had always dreamed of it and there it was happening.(Interview with El 'Pibe' Valderrama: a colombian legend).The most bizarre thing that happened to me with 'Cuatro Babys' was that the other assholes who wrote the song with me never had to face what happened. I was the one who had to take everything. To begin with, I didn\u2019t even write that song. I wrote my part, but people focused on what I had not written. I don't even sing the worst parts of the song. But I had to face the consequences. Then, the label gave the other artists a bunch of platinum records and the one who took all the shit, so to speak, was me.It is a good marketing strategy. It has always been a good marketing strategy. Madonna created her career out of controversy.Exactly, it has always been like that. Songs are created and people themselves make the monster grow, so to speak.Since I started. I remember when I opened a Twitter account and started tweeting my thoughts. I saw people started to respond to me and retweet everything I was saying. Then, I saw how that movement started to grow. I would post a song on Facebook and within two hours it had thousands of views. There and then I understood the reach, as a communication tool, that social networks gave me.People know how much I love him. He is my brother at heart, and he has helped me a lot in the decisions I have made in my career. He has brought me closer to other artists, like Puff Daddy. One night I invited him to a concert, and he told me: \u201cA friend who worked with me is coming too\u201d. I was in the dressing room when Marc came in and after three minutes Puff Daddy came in. And the three of us sat down and there is a famous photo of that encounter. A photo that I want to frame and put in my studio, where Marc is on the right, I am in the center and Puff Daddy is on the left: the three of us are drinking a tequila, enjoying ourselves, talking, and laughing at life. Three generations, three cultures and three totally different musical genres. Then, on stage, Puff Daddy waved at me and he kind of said: \u201cWhat happened, I want to go up!\u201d And I was shocked and happy. From that moment I can say that I have a very nice relationship with that man.Ha! That story is very funny. It was about four thirty in the morning, we were in Lisbon, Portugal, the last scene of the Medell\u00edn video, and I was so cold. A scene was missing where we had to ride an Arabian horse. I had a suit that was super tight on me, which they had designed specifically for that shot. When I went to ride the horse, my pants ripped. I couldn't get off because if I got off I was going to show them everything. Madonna was next to me, and she did not understand what was happening. We did the take, I got out and ran to the car.With Shakira there are many stories, but it must be when we were making one of our videos and we had to get into a bathtub full of milk. And I had never gotten into something like that. I felt a bit awkward, and it was very uncomfortable. But at the end of the day, it was worth it. Shakira is awesome and I love her.Jennifer Lopez is an absolute boss. She has her team, her career, and her family very organized. She is a very balanced person, an idol, and a legend. She has been a teacher in many things, and now in my acting career. In acting, she was the first person to give me a shot and someone who helped me a lot.(You may be interested in:\u00a0David Beckham: a huge icon of the English team).It was the first time that I spoke to her. I had a good chemistry with Kim, and she started looking at me and I started laughing, because she wasn't moving her face at all. I asked her why she didn't move her face and she told me that she had something done, I don't know what the hell she had done to her face but that she couldn't laugh because it hurt. Then I started to laugh, and she told me not to laugh. She had to look the other way and play dumb.I bought it because I need it. That's my house in the air. Now, with the pandemic, I have hardly used it, but I live from tour to tour and so I needed it. I have my pajamas, my clothes, my toothbrush, my bed. I spend many hours there. Several people in Colombia shared with us their experience and gave us some recommendations. I bought it in Switzerland. It's a Gulfstream G450. I was on a tour in Europe and, I took advantage, one day I flew, went, saw it, fell in love with the plane and bought it.To the people who criticized me for buying a plane I tell them to work so that they can buy one and not be jealous.That is where, as an artist, you realize that music is a universal language. Then I went to Romania, and it was the same. Same in Switzerland, Poland, and in places that I didn't think my music would be known. And every time I go there, everything is sold out. It is very nice to be able to take my culture around the world and to be recognized for singing in Spanish and being able to take my language to the whole world.No, he invited me just to hang out. He showed me his car collection which by the way I think is the largest car collection in the world, more than 200 or 300 cars. I believe that his house in Abu Dhabi is as big as Manhattan. To be there feels like a movie and inspires and motivate you to work harder.All of the above. My gender is the Maluma genre.It is very comforting to be able to help my people. For me, that has been very nice because my sister is a key piece in of all this, she is the president of the foundation. My family has been very supportive and has always been in favor of helping those who need it most. And since they helped me, since they gave me so much affection in Medell\u00edn and in Colombia in general, I believe that the least thing I can do is try to return that with my foundation.I am a Catholic, but I let myself be guided a lot by Buddhism. Buddhism has given me a lot of focus. Obviously Colombia is recognized for Catholicism and since I was a child my parents have taken me to Mass, but I also think it is a balance, a cool balance with Buddhism. They are different paths, but at the end of the day they come to the same thing: love, self-love, and love thy neighbor. And in everything that has to do with love, I'll be there.(It's interesting:\u00a0How much money does Pope Francis earn?).I don\u2019t hate anything. I used to get annoyed when fans approached me when I was having lunch and asked me for videos for their family members or such. But after a while, you become kind of an expert at handling the subject. It would suck if you wanted to be a famous artist, and no one approached to you.I think I'm going to die doing this, this is what I like the most and I'm just starting out. I'm going to sing until God and life allow me to. Whether that\u2019s on the shower, a stage, or my house\u2019s living room with my family.An ordinary \u2018guy\u2019, a fighter, worker who wants to leave a legacy, make history, and spread my culture around the world.

All very common in this virgin land, which seems infinite.Some of the most common activities in this place include sport fishing, rock climbing, and rappelling, as well as iguana watching, navigating the Meta River, and watching the approximately 320 species of birds that live there. Tourists can also find pleasant outdoor spaces full of tradition, such as the El Tuparro National Natural Park, where they can get in touch with cultures such as the Sikuan or Guahibo Indians, in the Bojonawi reserve.According to the locals, its name, comes from 'pital', a sort of cord plantation. It is known as the Valle de Laboyos. It is a region where guava is one of the traditional fruits, and where you can enjoy the red of its coffee plantations and the beautiful landscape of the Magdalena valley.Tourism is one of their biggest sources of income. Among the attractions that stand out are the ancient rock paintings located in the Anserma, Guamal, Charguayaco, and Guacacallo trails.

    "maintext": "Pablo Escobar was one of the most feared men in Colombia for many years, as he was the founder of the now-extinct Medellin cartel, one of the most violent criminal organizations in the country.Over the years as his illegal business grew, Escobar accumulated huge amounts of money. Because of this, he spared no expense when it came to buying luxurious mansions.See some of the properties the Colombian kingpin owned in the country and in other parts of the world before his death in December 1993.(We recommend:\u00a0How much money does Pope Francis earn?).It was one of Escobar's best-known properties. Located in Puerto Triunfo, Antioquia, it has an estimated area of 3,000 hectares.At the entrance he had a Piper plane which he used to take cocaine to the United States for the first time. Moreover, he brought various exotic species from the African savannah, which later caused some serious damage to the environment.On the farm there were also buildings with dozens of rooms, roads, six swimming pools, 27 artificial lakes, its own gas station, an airstrip, heliports, hangars, etc.It was valued at 4,500 million Colombian pesos in 1983. Moreover, it was the meeting spot for the leaders of the Medell\u00edn cartel, Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez Gacha, Carlos Lehder, the Ochoa V\u00e1squez Brothers, among others. He had many visitors, both related to his criminal activities and other who would go there on vacation.The property was abandoned after the criminal\u2019s death, and later there were a series of legal battles fought by National Government in an attempt to get the land back. Today, after a full remodeling it works as a theme park.(Colombia is a soccer nation:\u00a0Interview with El 'Pibe' Valderrama: a national legend).Located in the municipality of El Pe\u00f1ol, Colombia, it was named after the capo's youngest daughter.Construction began in 1980, at the peak of the criminal's darkest and most violent decade. Some of the most infamous events were, the murder of the Minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara (1984), the genocide of the 30 criminals who kidnapped Escobar's father (1984), the murder of Colonel Jaime Ram\u00edrez, who led the mission at 'Tranquilandia', the capo's cocaine laboratory (1986), and the vile murder of Guillermo Cano, director of 'El Espectador', a newspaper that denounced his criminal activities (1986).(Colombian music:\u00a0'There were some indecent proposals... It was a painful situation': Karol G).La Manuela has eight hectares and is currently managed by the Mayor's Office of El Pe\u00f1ol.Over the years the butler's house, the soccer field, a swimming pool, and the round structure have been kept in good condition. The building was attacked several times by the paramilitary group known as \u2018Los Pepes\u2019. This property was located in a privileged area of Miami Beach, United States, as it had a striking view of the sea and the perfect location to build a pier. However, of the house, acquired by Escobar in the 80s, there is nothing left but a memory.As reported in \u2018Infobae\u2019, the mansion, located at 5860 North Bay Road, was seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in 1987.Since then, it has made headlines because of its buyers. In 2014 it was acquired by Christian Berdouare, founder of the Chicken Kitchen restaurant chain, who demolished it in 2016 to search for the \u201chidden treasures\u201d.After that, Berdouare put the property up for sale, reaching an agreement in December 2020 with Jarett Posner, founder of BMC Investments, who paid $10.95 million for the land. Its new owner plans to build a mansion on the site. (Do you know?:\u00a0Benefits of intermittent fasting).One of Escobar\u2019s most famous properties abroad is the \u2018Casa Magna\u2019, located between the beaches of Tulum, in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.According to \u201cDiario las Americas\u201d the land where the mansion was built was given to Escobar by the drug trafficker Amado Carrillo Fuentes, better known as \u201cThe Lord of the Skies\u201d.As reported by the media, the land was worth approximately $17 million. Among the locals it was rumored that the construction, which began in 1992, belonged to Escobar, they even claimed that he would fly there to check on the construction\u2019s progress.(Keep reading:\u00a0Who is Antonela Roccuzzo? Lionel Messi's discreet and amazing wife).It is worth remembering that in those days the drug trafficker had escaped from La Catedral prison, located in Antioquia, after being helped by various military personnel of the time.According to 'Infobae', in 1997, the property was seized by the Mexican Prosecutor's Office and was abandoned. Six years later, the Insured Assets Administration Service acquired it. In 2005 it was transferred to the Amansala company, which enabled it as Casa Magna Amansala Eco Chic Resort, which operated until 2008.Today it is a luxury hotel visited by tourists from all over the world who are eager to see the facilities, which once belonged to one of the most feared kingpins in the world.These are the countries currently requesting a covid passportThese are the best free courses from the top universities in the worldUSA and other countries where you cannot travel with your petTendencias EL TIEMPO",

The argentine Antonela Roccuzzo was on top of everything during her husband\u2019s farewell from Barcelona. For example, the 33-year-old woman was seen giving a handkerchief to her husband so he could wipe his tears.Antonela, who has been the soccer player\u2019s rock, prefers to go unnoticed and refrains from trying to be a celebrity or an influencer, something that can be quite difficult given that she is married to one of the most famous athletes in the world.Lio and Antonela met when he was 9 and she was 8. Antonela's cousin helped with the encounter when he took his teammate on vacation with his family. It was love at first sight and the rest is history.(Do you like soccer?:\u00a0David Beckham: a huge icon of the English team).Antonela was born in 1988 into a family that owns the '\u00danico' supermarket chain in Rosario (Argentina). Unlike her husband, she comes from a wealthy family, since the small store that her grandmother opened is today one of the most influential businesses in the region.As a child she practiced rhythmic gymnastics. She devoted five years of her life to the sport, training four days a week at the Gymnastics and Fencing Club of Rosario.Moreover, she has always been modest, despite the fact that at one point she had more than 4 million followers on her Instagram account, which she closed for a while. She later reopened it and today she has more than 16 million followers. Furthermore, she has three children with Messi: Thiago, Mateo, and Ciro, ages 8, 5, and 3 years old respectively.After the birth of her first child, Antonela decided to open a children's fashion brand, Enfans, with her cousin. Other members of her family have also joined to support the growing company.Another interesting fact is that the successful businesswoman did not finish either of the two careers that she began to study in Argentina, first dentistry and then journalism. Today, she is focused on learning English.(We recommend:\u00a0Interview with El 'Pibe' Valderrama: a colombian legend).Moreover, Messi and Antonela kept their relationship a secret during a few years, until 2009, when Lio admitted he had a girlfriend. The following year Antonela was introduced to the world during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.They married in 2017, on July 30, at a wedding in Rosario, which had more than 250 guests.Today, she is happy to join her husband in Paris where she hopes they can write another great chapter in their love story and family life.How much money does Pope Francis make?'There were some indecent proposals...

    "maintext": "Intermittent fasting is one of the most popular diets of the last 20 years for its promise to lose weight, increase energy, and lengthen life. However, is there actually scientific evidence to confirm these benefits? A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests that it does.The study was led by Mark Mattson, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University, in the United States, who, for more than 25 years, has researched the effects of diets on health and, in particular, has followed this regimen for two decades. According to him, based on the findings of previous studies, \u201cintermittent fasting could be considered another healthy habit\u201d.(Keep reading:\u00a0These are the best free courses from the top universities in the world).First of all, Mattson said that there are two ways to practice this diet: one that promotes eating all the meals of the day in a period of six or eight hours, and the 5: 2, in which for two days a week people limit themselves to eating only one medium-sized meal a day.\u201cAccording to Johns Hopkins University, several clinical studies involving animals and people revealed that spreading periods of fasting with periods of ingestion promotes cellular health, perhaps because it activates the so-called metabolic change, which is the ancestral biological adaptation to periods of food scarcity\u201d.This change occurs when cells deplete glucose stores and use fat as an energy source through slower metabolic processes. According to Mattson, the studies analyzed indicate that this change improves glycemic regulation, increases resistance to oxidative stress and decreases inflammation.(This could be interesting:\u00a0Why do cats purr?).In his review article, Mattson cautions that the results of four studies, both with animals and with people, revealed that intermittent fasting also lowers blood pressure, lipid levels, and heart rate at rest. Furthermore, he said that the findings suggest that fasting can modify risk factors associated with obesity and diabetes.\u201cBased on two studies conducted by the University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, in which 100 overweight women participated, it was concluded that, compared to the patients in the subgroup who followed the calorie-limited diet, those who followed the diet 5 : 2 not only lost the same amount of weight as the others, but also obtained better results in the insulin sensitivity test and in reducing abdominal fat\u201d, said the team.(We recommend this:\u00a0Top five destinations to include in your vacation plans for 2021).Other recent studies showed that intermittent fasting also benefits the brain. In April, for example, the University of Toronto conducted a multicenter clinical trial involving 220 healthy, normal-weight adults. The participants followed a calorie-limited diet for two years, and after undergoing a series of cognitive tests, their memory was found to have improved.\u201cIt is clear that more research is still needed to confirm the effect of intermittent fasting on memory and learning. If confirmed, this diet can be a medical tool to prevent neuronal degeneration and senile dementia\u201d says Mattson.(Be carefully:\u00a0These are the countries currently requesting a covid passport).\u00a0Mattson acknowledges that science does not yet fully understand the biological mechanisms of metabolic change and cautions that some people might not be able to adhere to the fasting regimen. However, he claims that with patience and under proper medical supervision, most could incorporate this diet into their lives.How much money does Pope Francis make?USA and other countries where you cannot travel with your petInterview with El 'Pibe' Valderrama: a colombian legendEL TIEMPO*Based on information from Johns Hopkins University.",

Then, a few weeks ago France joined the list, only people who can provide a vaccine certification, a negative test, or proof that they are cured, will have access to certain places.(You may be interested in:\u00a0These are the best free courses from the top universities in the world).In the spring, Hungary, Austria, and Denmark were among the first European countries to implement COVID certificate systems. In Denmark for example, it is still mandatory to access various places, such as hair salons or gyms.Furthermore, Hungary, which had a quick vaccination roll out using Russian and Chinese vaccines, began issuing \u201cimmunity certificates\u201d since March.(We recommend: The top places to live during retirement).In the case of Austria, since the general reopening took place in mid-May, it was mandatory to present a negative test, an antibody certificate, or a vaccination certificate in hotels, restaurants, gyms, museums, concerts, hair salons, and sporting events. This rule remains in effect.The European certificate uses a code that allows authorities to check if the carrier is vaccinated or has a recent negative test. This document\u2019s use started on July 1 in the European Union.It allows travelers to cross the borders of 33 countries. These include the 27 Member States of the European Union and six other neighbor countries (Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, and Switzerland). In any case, the rules vary according to the destination and the country of origin.In Portugal, a health pass is required to stay in a hotel or for group classes in gyms. It is also mandatory to access the interior rooms of the restaurants, but only on weekends and holidays.In Ireland, the COVID certificate is only necessary to access the interior rooms of restaurants and pubs.(This could be interesting:\u00a0Young man tattooed a covid vaccination certificate to travel safely).In France, the COVID certificate became mandatory on July 21 to enter cultural and leisure establishments (museums, cinemas, theme parks, festivals, fairs) that host more than 50 people.It is extended (for those over 18 years old) to cafes, restaurants, airplanes, trains, buses for long trips and business trips. The certificate will also be mandatory for visitors or patients at clinics and hospitals (unless they have to go to the ER) and nursing homes.Italian authorities decided to make the covid passport mandatory from August 6 to enter movie theaters, museums, and gyms, and to eat inside restaurants.This \u201cGreen Pass\u201d will be mandatory for passengers on domestic flights, long-distance trains, and ferries from September 1, as well as for teachers, staff of schools and universities, and university students.(Read more:\u00a0How much money does Pope Francis make?).In Spain, Galicia (north) introduced the health certificate to access bars, restaurants, and nightclubs in the most affected municipalities. Similar measures were blocked by the courts in the Canary Islands and Andalusia (south).In Germany, depending on the federal states, a vaccination certificate or negative test may be required to access places such as hotels, gyms, and cinemas.Faced with new outbreaks, Israel partially established the certificate at the beginning of August. Only people who are fully vaccinated, cured of covid-19, or who have a negative PCR test can enter a place that welcomes more than 100 people, indoors or outdoors.(Also could read:\u00a0USA and other countries where you cannot travel with your pet).Amid a new COVID-19 outbreak, in the United States, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the \u201cKey to NYC\u201d, meaning covid certificates, is being used from August 16, followed by a one-month transition period.This consists of a proof of vaccination for \u201cemployees and customers of restaurants, sports scenarios, and theaters\u201d. In this way, New York City will be the first of the big cities of the United States to implement a health certificate.In Quebec, Canada, people who wants to eat inside a restaurant, exercise in the gym, or attend a festival must present a covid passport as of September 1, the Minister of Health of this province, Christian Dub\u00e9, announced.\u201cOur goal with the passport is to avoid new lockdowns and, at the same time, to avoid crowding our hospitals\u201d, he said during a press conference. Quebec is the first province in Canada to implement the health passport, mandatory for anyone who wants to \u201caccess crowded public events and activities with high rates of contact and socialization.\u201d(Don't stop reading:\u00a0David Beckham: a huge icon of the English team).In Chile, to obtain the health passport, the people must present an affidavit, through the website of the Ministry of Health, in addition to undergoing a temperature check and answering the questions of the health authorities.It is important to point out that this document has not been made mandatory to access leisure activities or venues. On the other hand, the Chilean Embassy in Colombia updated its protected borders plan on Tuesday, which states that only Chilean and foreign citizens who are permanent residents will be allowed to enter the country.(Do you know this? :\u00a0Why do cats purr?).In Uruguay, the Ministry of Public Health (MSP by its abbreviation in Spanish) enabled on its website the option to get \u201cAuthorization to enter Uruguay\u201d, or \u201ccovid passport\u201d, which must be filled out by anyone who wishes to enter the country. Uruguay could be one of the first countries in Latin America to apply the health certificate for travel. Keep in mind that it has not been made mandatory for leisure activities or places such as restaurants or cafes.In Argentina the covid passport has been available since July 26. \u201cStarting Monday, we will begin to use the Covid Passport, which will enable businesses to increase their capacity by 20% with Buenos Aires residents who were vaccinated at least 21 days before with the first dose\u201d, said the former mayor of La Matanza, Ver\u00f3nica Magario, in her twitter account.'There were some indecent proposals...

    "maintext": "Karol G\u2019s career was a family affair from the beginning. In fact, it was the big project of the Giraldo Navarro family. Her career began as a child as soon as she demonstrated a charming voice and a fascination for any family setting that involved songs and an audience. Carolina Giraldo Navarro (February 14, 1991) was born and raised in Medell\u00edn. She was the youngest of three daughters in a wealthy middle-class household who showed promise from early on.(You could be interested:\u00a0Anuel AA asks Karol G to come back in full concert).When she was five years old, he became the promoter, manager, and coach who took the young artist to sing at village fairs, to a children's reality show, to sign her first contract at age 14 and even to the United States in 2009. Although that time he told her to leave the meeting after she was asked to be a songwriter and not the main star.Her father, Guillermo, an empirical musician, assumed very early \u2013 stubbornly like a good paisa \u2013 her career, which is why today everyone knows her as Karol G and him as Papa G.She says her career had to take \u201cthe slow route\u201d. Something that the two of them understood when they hugged in Don Francisco Te Invita, in 2018, when the veteran host welcomed him as: \u201cHe is the father of Karol G!\u201d as he entered the set and she, a 27-year-old artist with a successful studio album (Unstoppable, 2017), greeted him proudly.Four months earlier, in January 2018, Karol G had won the Latin Grammy for best new artist and took her father on stage with her. \u201cI want to share this with this man here, who is 99 percent of the success of my career: my dad!\u201d To which he added: \u201cTo the Academy, to the Latin Grammys, and to everyone in the industry: thank you for believing in our project and God bless you\u201d(A recomnendation:\u00a0The most notorious infidelity scandals in the world of Hollywood).By then, Karol G had been signed to Universal Music for two years, the same record company of big stars of the urban genre like J Balvin, Daddy Yankee, and Don Omar. All this after a persevering career that put made her the first woman to succeed as a soloist within the new generation of reggaeton, singing openly sexualized lyrics just like the men in the business.Today, she is the #1 Latina in the world for the second consecutive year (2019 and 2020), according to Billboard, the most viewed singer on YouTube, and one of the most listened to on Spotify, where she has 33 million monthly listeners and an accumulated of more than 2,200 million streams, at least by the end of 2020. Her last megahits, 'Bichota' and 'Ay, Dios mio', were certified with 5 and 6 platinum albums, respectively. In Medellin, it is not uncommon for one of these songs to be a cell phone ringtone in a pharmacy, or for younger children to sing it while carrying a cell phone in any popular neighborhood. She is an omnipresent musical figure in Colombia.In 2020, as the world was reeling from the pandemic, she reached an important throne with her song 'Tusa', a song alongside Nicki Minaj, which debuted at # 1 on Billboard's Hot Latin Song chart and became the number 1 streamed song of 2020. Quite a phenomenon.On that same year, Karol G attended the Latin Grammy gala with a pink Dolce & Gabbana dress with a slogan: \u201cUn hombre le pag\u00f3 mal, ya no se le ve sentimental.\u201d Moments later she did one of the main numbers with a band composed exclusively of women. Harpist, drummer, bassist, cellist, and violinists reaffirmed Tusa as anthem of the year in the middle of an evocative setting of Mount Olympus where she, Karol G, was a mythological figure: the \u2018Bichota\u2019. \u201cDice que por otro man no llora, pero si le ponen la canci\u00f3n [...]\u201d, she sang.Furthermore, she was nominated in three categories on that year, including best recording of the year by 'Tusa'. Today, she remembers the moment, many years ago, when she envisioned that scenario. \u201cSomeday there will be a whole audience going to a place for me\u201d, she told herself one of the first times that she introduced herself as a backup singer for Reykon 'el l\u00edder', a Colombian reggaeton singer, more than ten years ago.(Read more:\u00a0Greeicy Rend\u00f3n will premiere a new song with Alejandro Sanz).Karol G has a sweet and friendly voice. She just turned 30 years old and wears blue hair, just like when he was in school. She studied at Calasanz, a religious female school in Medell\u00edn. Her first YouTube channel was called CaritoGCol, which she started in 2010 and uploaded only three videos there. She has a tattoo on her right forearm with the faces of her three great musical loves: Rihanna, Selena Quintanilla, and herself.On her latest album, Ocean (2019), she collaborated with Damian Marley, Anuel AA, Yandel, Maluma, J Balvin, and Nicky Jam. Culpables, one of the most successful songs on that album, was the origin of her relationship with Anuel AA, the Puerto Rican ragboy with whom she got engaged in 2020, although it seems their relationship ended in the last few days.\"I had very indecent proposals along the way, from people for whom you become a product. It was a very painful situation\", she said.Her career keeps growing every day because it is a crucial part of a musical genre that has captured world pop since 2015. At the beginning of February, the Bloomberg portal, an American corporation that provides global financial information, ranked her as number 10 of its Pop Star Power Rankings, the list that measures, month by month, the 25 biggest pop stars in the world and that currently includes five Puerto Ricans (Bad Bunny as # 1 on the list) and four Colombians.Now, she is preparing the release of her third studio album: KG0516, an encrypted name of May 16, 2005, the date of \u201cthe first time that in I was legally called Karol G on paper\u201d. It includes a cover designed by David Lachapelle and a seven-minute reggaeton tribute song featuring Ivy Queen, Zion, Wisin y Yandel, and Nicky Jam, and a feature with rapper Ludacris and a tiktoker girl that she found one day while she was scrolling on her cell phone. \u201cI'm going to pass away [laughs]. If this album doesn't come out, I'm not going to last\u201d, she says, with the same smirk that\u2019s the signature of all her music videos.In my family it was super crazy because from day one they believed that everything was possible, especially my closest family: my parents and my sisters. Since I started saying that I wanted to be a singer, they were always there. I think that video was from my first \u201cconcerts\u201d. It is amazing to have photos and videos of those moments because today I can see how far we have come and remember that since I was little I wanted to be here.(Also see:\u00a0Maluma will have his wax figure in the famous Madame Tussauds museum).My dad always wanted to be a singer. He had a music group with which he played at village parties; it was his hobby. Several times he took me to sing Pimpinela songs with him. The first artists I listed to were Pimpinela, Sandro, Tormenta, also a lot of vallenato. Thal\u00eda was an artist that I fell in love with hard when I heard her for the first time, and she was so young. But my dad also listened to a lot of music in English: The Bee Gees, Metallica. I was very romantic in my early years. My style was similar to those ballads that I heard when I was little.I had a dream of becoming a professional motorcycle rider. I have two cousins who have done motocross for many years, and they have won several awards. But there was no way my parents would let me follow that path. One of my cousins had a very bad accident and from that moment on it was forbidden to ride a motorcycle in my house. Whenever I met with my cousins I would ride with them, but that was that. Nowadays, it is one of my favorite hobbies, I really like riding two-wheel motorcycles. But actually, of all my talents, my favorite one was music.At school I was a very introverted girl. I was very shy and did not have that much self-esteem or many relationships with people, but I was the best one in music class. At least there was a class where I didn\u2019t have to do things alone, nor wait to see who was left to work with. In music class there was always someone who wanted to be with me. It was my moment of glory.(Keep reading:\u00a0Bad Bunny sweeps the nominations for the 2021 Billboard Latin Awards).Never. Actually, I was recently talking to someone on my team that you are raised by codes. Some people manage to let them go and develop their personality more, but there are others in which those codes remain for life. In my house we were a traditional Colombian family that went to mass every Sunday and on Saturdays we visited my grandmother, so I never had a problem with my school's education. Maybe, in 10th and 11th grades, I have to say that I was a very rebellious girl.First, I got piercings on my nose, on my tongue, on my ears. My face looked like a display of earrings. Then I began to dye my hair in all the colors I could think of. In fact, when I wanted to dye my hair blue right now, it was because I told my team: \u201cOh, I want to feel like when I was in school.\u201d I became a bit annoying for teachers because I encouraged a lot of practical jokes.I was born in La Mota, in Medell\u00edn. I spent my first years of life there and then we moved to a place called El Vel\u00f3dromo, a quiet neighborhood, very lonely, not many people to hang out with, as they do in other neighborhoods, and which I love. There weren't many things to do. I was the typical 15-year-old girl who went to parties and left early. I would arrive at nine at night and at twelve they would pick me up. Literally, I would eat and leave. The only full fifteen-year-old party I ever got was mine. I believe that throughout all these years I have experienced many things that I did not experience when I was younger.Yes, the theme of the party was Tinkerbell, and my dress was orange. It was very funny because out of a hundred guests, my mom only allowed me to invite 28 friends. I will never forget that number.(This might be interested for you:\u00a0\u00a0Jennifer Aniston's loves).\u00a0The first urban sounds that I heard, more than those of Puerto Rico, were those of Los cuentos de la cripta, who were from Panama. Cuentos de la Cripta were everything! I also listened to La Factor\u00eda and from there I began to listen to the first reggaeton songs, such as La gasolina. I really liked 'Latigazo', by Daddy Yankee, and Dembow, by Wisin y Yandel. It was love at first sight. I have loved reggaeton since I heard it the first time. Actually, I didn\u2019t end up singing this genre because it touched me or to fit in, or to sing what was happening. The moment I called myself Karol G, I knew that my music was going to be reggaeton, urban music.When the commercials for the second season of 'XS Factor' started, my dad insisted that I go. He sent a family member to line up and he came back with the number. The next day I had to go and do the audition. I went with the flow. I went to the final and traveled to Bogot\u00e1, where I had to compete against 150 children. I didn't make it to the tv performances. When there were eleven of us left and they chose six, I was sent home. The disappointment was huge for my parents. They blamed each other a lot. They said that maybe I didn\u2019t wear the right clothes, that maybe I didn\u2019t choose the right song. It was a very nice learning moment. After that, I came back to Medellin determined to be more outgoing.Yes, I was part of it for five years. I had classes on Fridays and Saturdays, five to six hours a day. It was a very brutal process because it was understanding music not only as a hobby. I began to see greatness, profession, and art. I studied the history of music and the reading of musical notes. Thanks to that knowledge I can sit down today to produce one of my songs. I am not a professional producer, but thanks to that time, I understand music. That time really helped me to fine tune my skills.(We recommend: David Beckham: a huge icon of the English team).The fact that I got in [laughs]. When I finished the music group I applied, and you know that at the University of Antioquia the spots are limited, not everyone makes it pass the application exam. It was very satisfying for me. In a very crazy way because I also applied to the University of Antioquia for a degree in foreign languages. I had many things that I wanted to study: graphic design, at some point international business, but, anyway, music pulled me in a different direction.No. When I started undergrad, I had a great opportunity to work as a backup singer for Reykon. He was very popular at the time, touring countless countries. I wanted to give myself an opportunity to understand music from that side, to really learn what a show was like, how the press was handled. I worked with Reykon for two and a half years, almost three. They were my first stages with an audience and that made me able to visualize myself and say: \u201cSomeday there will be an entire audience going to a place for me.\" That was a very special university for me.I was the girlfriend of Reykon\u2019s producer. He invited me to a trip to San Andr\u00e9s where they had a show for a quincea\u00f1era, on a boat. When we were on the boat I said to Reykon: \u201cCome on, Andr\u00e9s - which is his real name -, give me a microphone and let me do the chorus for you. I swear I'm not going to make you look bad\u201d. Then he gave me the microphone and I was behind doing harmonies. About three weeks later they made a formal proposal to me: \u201cHey, Karol, we loved what we did that day. We watched the videos, and it was so cute that we want you to be part of the team. We would love for you to be a backup singer and travel with us on tours \u201d. I didn't even think about it, it was an immediate yes. So, I dropped out of college because I was convinced that what I could learn at that time was going to mean a lot in the evolution of my career.Those covers were the tests given by my coach. I studied for almost six years with Mirabay Montoya, who is one of the best music teachers in Colombia. It was five days a week, and for exams she asked me to sing songs by Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, etc. I remember seeing Justin Bieber's process and I realized that he had been booked for a video that he had uploaded singing to YouTube. I said: \u201cIt's something I have to try, maybe it will also happen for me\u201d Nothing extraordinary ever happened to me with those videos though; people saw them, but it never opened any doors for me.(You could read:\u00a0Interview with El 'Pibe' Valderrama: a colombian legend).One day, while I was talking to my vocal coach like a doll just playing around. She said, \u201cWow, are you capable of doing voices like that?\u201d She had direct contact with the person who is in charge of doing all the Play Doh, Hasbro, and Barbies commercials in Colombia, which is someone who takes the commercials in English and does them in Spanish for all of Latin America. She took me and he told me to do voices. I had never done it, but I tried to do what he asked me and he was pleasantly surprised by that. I did that for like two years. See, I\u2019ve done it all, even TV commercials [laughs]. I was the voice of Polly Pocket, of Barbie, of little girls playing with dolls. In the end, I remember saying: \u201cThey are the new pets you can collect from Hasbro\u201d [laughs].I had very indecent proposals along the way, from people for whom you become a product. It was a very painful situation. It was very nice to have my dad supporting me in those moments. I used to say to him: \u201cDaddy, that person is suggesting weird things that make me feel uncomfortable and I think we should run\u201d. My dad believed in me, and we made the decision to do it the slow way. We did not have the contacts, nor did we know the industry, but thanks to certain people we met along the way, we began to do concerts in schools, shows with radio stations, performances at municipal parties. J Balvin for example, was a crucial person in my career. Selflessly, he introduced me to many people and introduced my project to many people as well. It was the slow way, but it was done with dignity.Someone told my mom that there was a person called A&R (artists and repertoire) at the record companies, who was in charge of finding new artists. When she heard that, she started calling different record labels from Colombia. I remember we made some physical records and she first traveled to Miami and New York, then she got a face-to-face meeting. My dad, my mom, and I went to Universal in Miami, we sat down and listened to my album. That A&R told us: \u201cLook, here's a CD of a woman who sings reggaeton. That is not going to happen, but what if you are a composer for other artists within the label?\u201d And my dad took it very badly. He took the folder he had, closed it and said: \u201cMy daughter is not anyone's composer. You are not going to take her work to fill someone else\u2019s pockets. We are leaving. Seven years later, seven years later! We received a formal offer from Universal that they wanted to sign me as an artist, and I have been with this label for four years.I came to Ovy\u2019s studio (Ovy on the Drums), the producer I have worked with for six years, and he had made a beat with a melody that sounded like the song Mil Horas. I told him that I did not dare to do something like that masterpiece, but that we could try to make a new song. I told my dad about the idea, but we had no connections. My dad kept calling different people until he reached Calamaro's manager, and it was incredible because three or four weeks later, Calamaro was playing at the Est\u00e9reo Picnic in Bogot\u00e1. We went there to meet him. It is amazing to think that we started at home thinking about what to do with a song and ended up sitting at the table with the artis who wrote it and obtaining legal permission for the song. Another bonus point for my dad, he works hard until he makes things happen.(Read it:\u00a0This is what Tainy and Yandel told us who celebrate their friendship with 'Dynasty').My team was me and my dad. So, I was Karol G's assistant. When I called places I would say: \u201cHi, this is Karol G's assistant\u201d [laughs]. I remember that in my assistant email I received a message where they said that they wanted to have a meeting because there was a formal proposal from Universal, that they wanted to have Karol G as a company artist. At that moment I panicked because my dad and I were alone, we didn't understand the business very well. So, I took a beat, I didn't even reply to the email. I started looking for a manager. I found three people who gave me an incredible vibe and who knew the industry; it was a group of managers, one had worked at Universal, one at Warner, and the other at Sony. I signed with them, and we answered the Universal email. Like: \u201cOkay, we just saw this email, what should we do\u201d? [laughs]. They sent a person from Miami to Medellin, and I remember that when we sat down I said to him: \u201cWhat made you call me back after seven year?\u201d And he told me that they did a study to evaluate all the new artists and see which ones had the most international projection. That study gives them ten names in the world and Karol G. was on that list. At that time, I was very impressed that they did that kind of thing. Then we started negotiating and finally we signed.I was the first woman they all sang with. They were a very important part in the development of my career because at that time there were few opportunities for people to hear a female singer in this genre. It was very important to me that their fans said: \u201cWow! If Ozuna is singing with her, then I want to listen to her.\u201d I felt like their darling girl because I had no other opportunities, neither on radio nor on television, to express myself, but they gave me that opportunity and that made my work evolve faster.Of course, you know why? I have realized that it is not that there are no women in this business, but that there are no opportunities for us. Not only in this industry, but in all professions, women have to fight a little more to have credibility, something that shouldn\u2019t happen. We are just as talented, we have the same capabilities, sometimes we are even more organized and strategic. I\u2019ve met women with so much talent that it made me think: \u201cSo\u2026 Are there female producers? Are there female sound engineers? Are there awesome female guitarists? I mean, so much talent to show, but why doesn't anyone show it? Well, in this team, we are going to showcase that\u201d. So, in my team the majority are women. If I can give the opportunity to other women to show their ability, I will. In my new album one of the goals that I set myself is that I wanted to collaborate with female singers, but not with the ones that people expect, but with the women who are great and need to be showcased. That\u2019s why I have Nathy Peluso, Mariah Angeliq, and Kali Uchis did the voice in the visual intro of my album.Apple, the company with the highest price in the worldWoman married her brother's murderer; letters were sent from jailYoung woman with double uterus talks about her extreme and painful conditionKAREN PARRADO BELTR\u00c1NRevista BOCAS",
